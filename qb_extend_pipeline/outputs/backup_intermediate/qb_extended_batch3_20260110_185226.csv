        Where was Toad? He was sitting in the middle of the dusty road. He stared at the motor car as it drove away. Toad went into a kind of dream. His face looked calm and peaceful. He said quietly, ""toot-toot!"" Rat shook him by the shoulder, but Toad did not move at all.""What a beautiful sight!"" Toad said softly. ""That is the REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel! Oh my! Oh my! I must get one!"" Mole tapped Rat on the shoulder, but Toad kept talking.""I can't believe I never KNEW about this!"" he said. ""All those years are wasted now. I never knew about motor cars. I never even dreamed about them! But NOW I know. Oh, what fun I will have! What dust clouds will form behind me when I speed down the road! What wagons I will push into the ditch! Those awful little wagons, common wagons, yellow-colored wagons!""

""What should we do with him?"" asked Mole. ""There is nothing we can do,"" said Rat. ""He has gone mad. He has got a new idea stuck in his head. It is always like this when he starts something new. He will go on like that for days now. He will walk around in a happy dream. He won't be able to do anything useful. Never mind him. Let's go see what we can do about the wagon.""They looked at the wagon carefully. They found that it would not work anymore. One wheel had been broken into many pieces. ""Come on!"" said Rat. ""We will have to walk. It is five or six miles to the nearest town. The sooner we start walking, the better.""""But what about Toad?"" asked Mole. ""We can't leave him here sitting in the middle of the road by himself! It's not safe. What if another motor car comes along?"" ""Never mind him,"" said Rat. ""I'm done with him!""

They had not walked very far when they heard footsteps behind them. Toad caught up with them. He put his paw inside each of their arms. ""Now, look here Toad!"" said Rat in a sharp voice. ""As soon as we get to the town, you must go straight to the police station. You must see if they know anything about that motor car. You must find out who owns it. You must complain because your wagon is broken. Then, you must go to a blacksmith so he can fix the wagon. Meanwhile, Mole and I will find rooms where we can stay until the wagon is ready.""""Police station? Complain?"" said Toad in a dreamy voice. ""Why would I complain about that beautiful motor car? I am done with wagons forever. I never want to see that wagon again or hear about it. Oh, Ratty!"" The animals spent the night in town.

        Where was Toad? He was sitting in the middle of the dusty road. He stared at the motor car as it drove away. Toad went into a kind of dream. His face looked calm and peaceful.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.

Most crocodiles only eat once a week, but they can live for months without eating!",,,,,What is the central focus of the information Rattenborough presents throughout this article?,MCQ,the different ways animals survive in nature,the methods scientists use to organize animals,the reasons some animals are endangered,the habitats where various animals live,B,"Incorrect.

Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals. Most crocodiles only eat once a week, but they can live for months without eating!",,,,,"According to paragraph 5, what does the statement 'Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool' reveal about their survival strategy?",MCQ,They have developed physical features that eliminate the need for temperature regulation entirely,They depend on behavioral adaptations like choosing sunny or shady spots rather than internal processes,They must hibernate during extreme weather because they cannot control their temperature,They evolve more quickly than warm-blooded animals to match their environment,B,"Incorrect. The passage clearly states cold-blooded animals 'must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right,' so they do need temperature regulation. They just use external methods (sun, water, mud) rather than internal energy, not eliminate the need entirely.",Correct! The statement contrasts with warm-blooded animals who use internal energy. The passage then explains cold-blooded animals 'use things around them' like lying in sun or staying in water/mud—these are behavioral choices to regulate temperature externally rather than internal physiological processes.,"Incorrect. The passage does not mention hibernation. It describes active behaviors like moving to sun or water/mud to regulate temperature.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.

The passage does not discuss appearance similarity between mammals and crocodiles. Instead, it focuses on concrete differences like hair vs. scales, live birth vs. eggs, and milk vs. independent feeding. The contrast is about characteristics, not misleading appearances.","Correct! The author lists specific criteria: mammals have hair, give live birth, and produce milk; crocodiles have scales, lay eggs, and babies eat independently. This detailed contrast shows that scientists use observable, measurable characteristics to determine which group an animal belongs to, supporting the classification theme.","Incorrect.
