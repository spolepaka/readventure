          "standard_alignment": "RL.3.2 requires students to recount stories and determine the central message, lesson, or moral. This question asks about a lesson the story teaches, but the passage doesn't clearly demonstrate Alice learning or embodying the lesson 'stay calm and keep trying.' The standard requires identifying themes explicitly supported by the text, not inferring general life lessons.",
          "clarity_precision": "The question is ambiguous because it asks what 'lesson the story teaches' without clearly defining whether it means what Alice learns, what readers should learn, or what the author intended. Additionally, 'dealing with confusing situations' is vague and could apply to multiple aspects of Alice's journey.",
          "single_correct_answer": "The passage doesn't clearly support option A as the definitive correct answer. Alice doesn't consistently demonstrate staying calm (she shows anger multiple times) or a clear pattern of persistence leading to success. Other interpretations could be equally valid based on the text.",
          "difficulty_assessment": "For Grade 3, this question may be slightly challenging due to a few factors. Firstly, the vocabulary and phrases such as 'everyone in this place is mad, including me and you,' and 'a grin without a cat' are complex and could be confusing. Secondly, the abstract reasoning required to understand the thematic implications of Alice's experiences and extract a lesson about handling confusing situations may be too demanding for this age group, typically between 8 to 9 years old. The literal comprehension of the text might be manageable, but the inferential reasoning about life lessons from the story would likely be intricate for most children in this grade."

Option D 'Alice solves the raven riddle' is also implausible since the passage ends mid-sentence without Alice solving anything.",

This question is asking students to organize narrative events in sequence, which is more aligned with story structure/sequencing standards rather than using visual and textual information for comprehension.",
          "clarity_precision": "The question is ambiguous about what constitutes 'Conversation 3.' The chart format suggests discrete conversations, but the tea party scene contains multiple overlapping exchanges about room at the table, lemonade, and invitations that blur together rather than forming distinct conversations.",
          "single_correct_answer": "Both A and C could be considered correct. The argument about room at the table and the discussion about lemonade occur in the same continuous exchange and are equally valid as 'Conversation 3' since there's no clear delineation between conversations in the text.",
