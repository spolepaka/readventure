His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. \"Tell me, young man,\" said the stranger. \"Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?\"\"Yes, I am,\" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. \"My dear nephew!\" he cried out. \"Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!\"\n\n---\n\nAladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. \"Come with me today,\" he said to the boy. \"I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city.\" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.\"Go gather some dry sticks,\" the magician told Aladdin. \"We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.\"Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.\n\n---\n\n\"Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,\" said the magician. \"It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.\"Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.\"Take this special ring,\" said the magician. \"It will keep you safe from any harm.\" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.\"Give me your hand, Uncle,\" Aladdin called out. \"Help me climb out!\"\"First, hand me the lamp,\" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. \"I cannot reach it right now,\" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him \"richer than any king in the world.\"What does this phrase mean?\n- A) Aladdin will have more money than he can count\n- B) Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom\n- C) Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave\n- D) Aladdin will meet kings from other countries\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.4.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What causes the magician to trap Aladdin in the cave?\n- A) Aladdin doesn't give him the lamp right away.\n- B) Aladdin won't to go into the cave.\n- C) Aladdin takes too many gems from the cave.\n- D) Aladdin breaks the magic ring on his finger.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 3, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

The text uses this vivid phrase to describe how the ground opened up to reveal the stone covering the cave entrance. This is nonliteral language that means the ground separated or opened, showing what was underneath. The story confirms this by saying 'There in front of them lay a huge stone.'\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the phrase sounds like it could describe an earthquake, the text shows the ground opening in one specific spot to reveal the stone, not the whole mountain shaking. The magician's magic caused a controlled opening, not natural shaking.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician did not physically dig. He used magic words and perfumes to make the earth open. The phrase 'split open' is nonliteral language describing a magical event, not physical digging.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin did not fall. The earth opened to reveal a stone with stairs going down. Aladdin later chose to go down the stairs on purpose to get the lamp. The opening appeared in front of them, not under them.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 3, focusing on the dramatic magical event description.

This phrase shows Aladdin's amazement and disbelief at the incredible situation. The text says 'Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard' right after, confirming he found it hard to believe such an incredible treasure existed. This is nonliteral language expressing his shock and wonder.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The phrase is not about hearing problems. Aladdin understood the words perfectly - the text shows he followed all the instructions. The phrase expresses his emotional reaction of amazement, not a physical problem with hearing.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Language barriers are not the issue here. The phrase means Aladdin was amazed by how incredible the request was, not confused by the words. The text shows Aladdin understood completely because he 'agreed to help.'\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While Aladdin might have been nervous, the phrase describes his amazement and disbelief about the treasure, not fear. The text says 'he agreed to help,' showing he was willing, not refusing or scared into cooperating.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 4, analyzing character's emotional reaction phrase.

This phrase reveals the magician's true intentions - he wanted someone who would obey without questioning his motives. The nonliteral meaning shows he wanted a person he could control and manipulate, which is why he thought 'Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.'\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The phrase is not about teaching reading skills. It describes the type of personality the magician wanted - someone compliant who wouldn't question his plans. The magician's goal was to use Aladdin, not educate him.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Actually, the opposite is suggested. By wanting someone who wouldn't 'ask too many questions,' the magician wanted someone less likely to figure out his trick. Intelligence might lead to questioning, which he wanted to avoid.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Language ability is not mentioned in this phrase. 'Asking too many questions' refers to questioning the magician's plans and motives, not about speaking different languages.

The detail about perfumes in flames is part of describing the magical ceremony. Combined with 'spoke magical words in a loud voice,' these actions show the magician performing a spell. The dramatic results (sky turning dark, thunder, earth opening) confirm this was a magical ritual, not an ordinary use of perfume.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While perfumes do smell sweet, the purpose wasn't to make things smell nice. The perfumes were part of a magic spell. The text shows this by describing magical results: darkness, thunder, and the earth splitting open - not just pleasant smells.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. You don't put out fires by adding perfumes to them - that would make them burn more. The text shows the magician was using the fire as part of his magic spell to open the earth, not trying to extinguish it.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician was not cooking.

The text explains: 'When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.' Despite her surprise about never hearing of a brother, the promise of financial help convinced her. This shows how the magician manipulated the family with appealing promises.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story does not mention the stranger bringing any gifts. The mother welcomes him because of his promise to help Aladdin become a merchant and earn money, not because of presents. Reread paragraph 2 to find what actually convinced her.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin does not tell his mother the stranger is trustworthy. Aladdin simply brought the man home. It was the stranger's own promise about helping Aladdin become a wealthy merchant that convinced the mother to welcome him.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The stranger does not provide any proof. In fact, the text says the mother 'felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother.'

The text directly states: 'The impatient magician could not wait any longer.' When Aladdin asks for help climbing out first, the magician's impatience causes him to trap Aladdin instead of waiting. This action demonstrates his impatient character trait and contributes to the story's conflict.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text says they climbed for 'a whole hour,' but does not describe the magician walking quickly or impatiently during the climb. His impatience is shown later when he cannot wait for Aladdin to climb out of the cave.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician actually does give Aladdin detailed instructions about the treasure and what to do in the cave. His impatience appears later when Aladdin cannot immediately hand him the lamp. Review paragraph 5 for evidence of his impatience.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the magician comes in the morning, this does not demonstrate impatience. The text describes his impatience much later when he 'could not wait any longer' for the lamp and trapped Aladdin rather than helping him out.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 5, connecting character trait to specific action.

The text explains the cause-effect relationship: 'But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.' This action directly contributes to the problem that leads to the magician trapping him.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician does not see the gems or become jealous of them. He only cares about the lamp, as shown when he demands the lamp and ignores everything else. His anger comes from not getting the lamp immediately, not from jealousy about gems.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The ring does not break. The text says the ring 'will keep you safe from harm,' and there is no mention of it breaking. The problem is that the heavy bag makes it hard for Aladdin to climb, not that the ring breaks.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The gems do not provide light.

The text states: 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp.' When Aladdin cannot immediately give him the lamp, the magician's true character is revealed - he traps Aladdin without concern for his life. This action shows his selfishness and cruelty, contributing to our understanding of him as the villain.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story does not suggest the magician fears Aladdin will steal his powers. The magician has already given Aladdin a protective ring. His action shows he only wants the lamp and has no concern for Aladdin once he cannot get it immediately.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician does not believe Aladdin will escape - he uses magic to trap him permanently. The text shows 'Poor Aladdin was trapped,' indicating the magician intended to leave him there, not expecting him to find another exit.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

This detail directly demonstrates the central lesson. The magician makes big promises about making Aladdin a wealthy merchant, but his real intention is to use Aladdin to get the lamp. When Aladdin cannot give it immediately, the magician reveals his true nature by trapping him. This teaches readers to be cautious of strangers bearing promises.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While this detail shows the family's poverty and might explain why they believed the promises, it does not directly support the lesson about not trusting strangers who make big promises. This is background information, not evidence of the deceptive promise-making.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magical thunder shows the magician has powers, but it does not relate to the lesson about trusting strangers' promises. The lesson is about deception and false promises, not about magic abilities. Look for details showing broken promises or betrayal.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The author shows this lesson through the magician's actions. His greed for the lamp makes him so impatient that he makes the terrible decision to trap Aladdin rather than wait a few moments.

The lesson comes from the magician's greedy actions.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Climbing the mountain is part of the journey but does not demonstrate the greed lesson. The mountain climb shows effort and adventure, not greed or bad decisions. The lesson about greed appears later when the magician's impatience causes him to trap Aladdin.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The magician's dishonesty (pretending to be Aladdin's uncle) and impatience (trapping Aladdin instead of waiting) directly cause his failure. The story teaches that these negative traits can prevent success. His deception sets up distrust, and his impatience causes him to lose the lamp completely by trapping the only person who could retrieve it.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story is not teaching a lesson about travel being dangerous. The magician traveled successfully from Africa to Persia. His failure comes from his dishonest behavior and impatience, not from traveling. The lesson focuses on character flaws, not geography.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The story shows how the mother, despite being surprised her husband never mentioned a brother, believes the magician because he promises to help Aladdin 'earn good money.' Her financial struggles make her overlook the warning sign. This teaches that attractive promises can cloud judgment, which is part of the story's larger message about being careful with trusting strangers.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story teaches the opposite - the mother does NOT know the stranger is lying. She believes him despite her doubts because his promises appeal to her needs. This shows that even caring parents can be deceived, which is part of why we should be cautious.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The message is not to reject all help, but to be careful about who to trust. The problem is not accepting help itself, but believing someone whose story has warning signs (like a brother her husband never mentioned). The lesson is about careful judgment, not refusing assistance.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

While not explicitly stated, the text strongly suggests this through the magician's careful selection process. He specifically looks for 'a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions' and thinks 'Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.' The magician clearly cannot or will not get the lamp himself, implying the lamp requires someone with Aladdin's qualities - youth, innocence, and obedience - to retrieve it successfully.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician demonstrates physical ability by climbing the steep mountain for an hour and performing magic. His age or strength is never mentioned as a limitation.

Aladdin knows nothing about the lamp before meeting the magician. The text shows Aladdin is surprised by everything - 'Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard.

The lie is essential to the plot. By pretending to be family, the magician gains access to Aladdin and his mother's trust. This allows him to take Aladdin away from town and up the mountain without suspicion. The text shows the mother 'welcomed the man into their home' because of this claimed relationship, which enables all the subsequent events in the cave.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The lie proves the opposite - the magician does NOT care about the family.

This question requires analyzing how the magician's impatience directly caused his failure. Aladdin had the lamp and was willing to give it to him - he just needed help climbing out first because the bag was heavy.

This action reveals the magician's strategic thinking. He gives Aladdin the protective ring because he needs Aladdin to safely navigate the cave and return with the lamp.
