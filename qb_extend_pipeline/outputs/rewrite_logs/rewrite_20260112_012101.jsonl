The story shows the opposite - Adoette and Awan continued working together despite their disagreement.

Consider how the author presents Adoette's decision at the story's end.", "B": "Correct! Throughout the story, Adoette makes an independent decision that differs from Awan's advice ('You are crazy') and their assigned job (chasing crows away). However, she shows wisdom by recognizing the crow needs help ('other animals might hurt it'), earning its trust through patience, planning for its care ('we can store it safely until it can fly again'), and still fulfilling her crop-guarding responsibility. The author presents her as 'proudly' carrying the crow, validating her mature judgment.

While crop protection is important, the story shows Adoette successfully managing both responsibilities - she helps the crow AND guards the field ('For the rest of the day, the two children guarded the corn crop'). The author doesn't present these as conflicting priorities requiring a choice. Look at what Adoette actually accomplishes, not what she gives up.", "D": "Incorrect. Adoette doesn't strictly follow her instructions (to chase all crows away), yet she still completes her job successfully.

Adoette didn't sacrifice anything - she successfully completed her job ('For the rest of the day, the two children guarded the corn crop') while also helping the crow.

The crow is described as an 'enemy' and part of 'the worst enemy during this time' for crops. It wasn't gentle initially - it 'flapped its wings' when picked up.

The text focuses on Adoette's relationship with the crow and her journey with Awan, not on seeking attention from others.

The story opens with a spontaneous race and closes with another race back to camp, framing all the work activities with playful moments. Even though the family comes to camp for serious work - collecting sap, making syrup, hunting, and gathering bark - the children still find time to play and race. This structure shows that childhood joy and playfulness coexist with responsibility and work, conveying a theme about balanced childhood experiences.", "D": "Incorrect. The story shows the opposite - Flo and Meda are friends despite different racing abilities. After Flo wins, they talk kindly to each other, and Meda smiles while predicting she'll win next year. Their friendship is based on enjoying time together, not on equal abilities. The text emphasizes their connection, not their competition."}}

Throughout the story, Salali demonstrates protective care: she follows Dustu because she worries about him being alone, she notices his troubled mood and asks about it, she encourages him to apologize using the festival's cultural meaning, and she works to make him smile. These actions show the author conveying that caring for and supporting siblings through their struggles is important.", "C": "Incorrect.

The story actually shows the opposite - Salali doesn't command Dustu or expect his obedience. Instead, she asks questions, offers help, and provides gentle guidance.

While the story does include Cherokee cultural practices, Salali's promise about not marrying Elan is personal, not cultural. The text doesn't present promise-making as a cultural tradition like the apology practices during the festival. This promise is about sibling care, not cultural practice.", "B": "Incorrect. The word 'anything' is too extreme. Salali makes this specific promise because, as she notes, it's easy to keep since she plans to marry Elan's brother anyway. She isn't sacrificing something important - she's offering a gesture that costs her nothing but means something to Dustu. This shows wisdom, not unlimited sacrifice.", "C": "Incorrect.

After Salali tries multiple approaches to help Dustu (asking questions, giving advice about apologizing), she finally asks what would make him happy.

The story shows Dustu burdened by guilt - looking glum, acting sulkily, and being unhappy. Only after he confesses to Salali and she encourages him to apologize does his mood begin to lift. The author connects this to the festival's practice of apologizing, showing that acknowledging mistakes and making amends helps resolve guilt and creates opportunities for renewal.", "C": "Incorrect. Dustu's attempt to keep his mistake private makes him miserable, not protected. His glum, sulky behavior shows that keeping secrets creates internal suffering. The story's resolution - with Salali encouraging apology during the festival of renewal - suggests that openness and making amends are better than secrecy.", "D": "Incorrect. While Dustu does feel guilty, the story doesn't present this as sufficient. Instead, Salali encourages him to take action by apologizing to Elan, connecting this to the festival's renewal themes.

The author weaves together the practical task of gathering wood with meaningful conversation about Dustu's troubled feelings and the festival's significance. This structure shows that siblings can address important emotional and moral issues while doing routine work together. The setting creates a private, comfortable space for Dustu to eventually confess and for Salali to offer guidance.", "C": "Incorrect.

The vast majority of the passage describes the fort's design, defenses, and history. Learning about hurricanes is not the main idea.", "D": "Incorrect.

Paragraph 2 shows Tom's comfortable routine: 'Tom was very happy it was Sunday' because he 'could go hunting or fishing,' and he and William 'had been hunting and fishing together since Tom first came.' This establishes hunting as familiar, enjoyable routine. By paragraph 7, Tom faces something new - hunting deer with a Powhatan boy - and he's explicitly 'nervous' but working to 'pluck up his courage for this new adventure.' His view has shifted from comfortable routine to anxious challenge. Strategy: Compare a character's attitude toward the same activity at different points to track perspective changes.", "B": "Incorrect. Tom never viewed hunting as 'boring work.' Paragraph 2 shows he was 'very happy' about Sunday hunting. His perspective shift is from comfortable to nervous, not from bored to excited. Remember: Track the specific emotions the text attributes to the character.", "C": "Incorrect. Tom never wanted to avoid hunting - he looked forward to it on Sundays. Also, he doesn't become eager to teach others; he's still learning himself and feeling nervous. Remember: Don't exaggerate the character's development beyond what the text supports.", "D": "Incorrect. The passage doesn't indicate Tom had preferences between hunting and fishing initially - he did both happily.

By reminding Tom he 'survived the streets of London,' William is highlighting Tom's proven toughness and resilience to help him feel capable of facing this new challenge.

While the activists were concerned about discrimination, the poem's message is forward-looking. The text states they fought so 'brown children like me can grow up free,' showing their goal was improvement for the next generation, not worry.

The text connects Ohio and South Carolina positively, and the movement fought for freedom everywhere. Focus on what the activists were fighting for.", "C": "Correct! The text states people were 'fighting and marching and getting killed so that today...brown children like me can grow up free.' This shows the activists hoped their sacrifices would create a better, freer future for children like the speaker. Excellent inference connecting their actions to their feelings!", "D": "Incorrect. The text does not suggest confusion about having children.

The detail shows what kind of containers they used, revealing their limited resources as enslaved people. Focus on what the gourd itself represents.", "C": "Correct! Using 'scooped-out gourds' instead of manufactured cups or containers shows they had to create drinking vessels from natural materials.

Excellent understanding of how this detail reveals their circumstances!", "D": "Incorrect. The text describes them working 'dawn till dusk' in forced labor ('unfree' and 'unpaid'), not choosing to be outdoors for enjoyment.
