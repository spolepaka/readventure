## Q&A Backup

### Learning Data (TSA Pilot)
- **5 students, ~5 weeks → 100% improved**
- Range: +3 to +15 CQPM, avg +9
- Methodology: 60s minimum raid filter, same-track comparison

### Learning Data (Brownsville — Cross-System Validation)
- **Emma Schipper**: Alpha Math Speed Score (Dec 9) **13 CQPM** → Math Raiders peak (Dec 10) **18 CQPM**
- **+5 CQPM in 1 day** — same-day baseline from Alpha Math, validated cross-system

### "1 AM" Detail
- Seth Anders: 2 sessions at 1-2 AM (13 raids total)
- Logs: Nov 14, 1:23–2:07 AM (8 raids); Dec 11, 12:38–12:55 AM (5 raids)
- Broader stat: **63 raids outside school hours**, 40 before 7 AM

### "Siblings Co-op" Detail
- Atticus (older brother, already passed Fast Math) hijacked Octavia's account
- Guide asked us to set him up with his own account
- **Dec 11, 5 PM**: 7 co-op raids at home (logs: 4:53–5:05 PM)
- **Janna Peskett (Head of Academics)**: "That is VERY encouraging if her brother was playing her math game at home."
  - *Skeptic → believer arc*: Initially said (Nov 20) "might be a little too distracting... beeps and lights could interfere with memorization" — now enthusiastic

### Guide Quotes
- **Jessica Criss (Brownsville)**: "They are loving this app — some of the bigger kids want in on it now too!"
- **Camren Allred (Brownsville)**: "They are much more motivated and locked in during their FastMath time."

### Kid Quote
- **Emma (via Samantha Hilton)**: "It's so much better than Fast Math."
- Backup — Rob's 5-year-old: "I love this! Who made it? I like them a lot." *(Joe has seen)*

- Guide: "Kids were asking what time we were coming"
- After lunch: 3/4 immediately said yes to play again
- Everett: 76 raids, 114 min total (Dec 9–12)

## If Asked About Engagement Variance

| Student | Pattern | Response if Asked |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Seth | Power user (+14.5) | "Most engaged = biggest gains — engagement correlates with learning" |
| De'Marcus | Consistent (+9.6) | "Solid, steady player" |
| Renee | Dropped off W3 (+3) | "Hit her goal early, then focused on other subjects" |
| Peini/Xiaoheng | Sporadic (+13.4/+4.5) | "Guide prioritized other curricula — they still improved when they played" |

### Core Framing
> "Every student who played improved. More play = more gains. The game works."
