        There once was a poor boy named Aladdin. His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.",,,,,"In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him ""richer than any king in the world.""What does this phrase mean?",MCQ,Aladdin will have more money than he can count,Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom,Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave,Aladdin will meet kings from other countries,A,You successfully made a good prediction by using clues about the magic lamp and treasure. The text supports this when it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the magician promises it “will make you richer than any king in the world.” Remember to look for repeated hints and strong words like “will” to predict what will happen next.,"You may have thought “richer than any king” means Aladdin becomes a king, or you used what you know from other versions, but the text says the lamp “would make any person very rich” and “It will make you richer than any king,” which is about money, not ruling. So the correct answer is that Aladdin will have more money than he can count. Strategy: Reread and underline clue words like “rich/richer,” and choose the answer that matches exactly what the passage says—not what you expect from outside the story.","You may have brought in outside ideas (gold coins), but the text never mentions coins—Aladdin finds “beautiful gems,” and the lamp is said to make a person “very rich,” even “richer than any king.” That means the best prediction is about how much wealth he will have, not a specific kind of money, so “Aladdin will have more money than he can count” fits the text. Next time, stick to the exact words and look for clue phrases about the main idea, like “very rich.”","You may have focused on the word “king” and guessed he’d meet kings, but the text never says Aladdin will meet any kings; it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the treasure “will make you richer than any king in the world.” That evidence points to the correct answer: Aladdin will have more money than he can count. Strategy: reread for clue words and choose the option that matches what the passage actually says, not ideas it doesn’t mention.",2,medium,RL.3.4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,original

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them.

Next time, check that your answer matches what happens in the whole story, especially the results of the characters’ actions.","You successfully identified the lesson by noticing how a stranger’s big promises led to trouble. The text supports this when the man promises to help Aladdin “learn to become a merchant and earn good money” and says the treasure will make him “richer than any king in the world,” but then he traps Aladdin in the cave. Remember, when finding a story’s lesson, ask yourself, “What happens after a character makes a big promise?”","You may have focused on the detail that Aladdin’s mother works hard, but the story’s events point to a different lesson. Aladdin doesn’t become rich through hard work—the stranger pretends to be his uncle, promises to make him a merchant, then uses magic and traps Aladdin in the cave to get the lamp.

""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.

His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared!

Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.

The text supports this with “he rubbed the ring on his finger… a genie appeared” and “she… started rubbing the lamp.

When Aladdin rubs the ring “a genie appeared,” and when his mother rubs the lamp “a huge genie appeared,” so the magic items are the ring and the lamp, not the gems. Strategy: Reread for cause-and-effect clues (like “when he rubbed…, a genie appeared”) to choose the items that actually make things happen.","It looks like you focused on one event (his mother’s visit), but the text shows the ring and lamp are what make everything happen: the ring genie gets Aladdin out of the cave, and the lamp genie brings food, forty servants with bowls of gems, and even builds a palace—after this, the Sultan agrees. So the correct answer is the magic ring and lamp because they help Aladdin again and again, not just once. Strategy: ask yourself, “What helps the main character throughout the whole story, not just in one scene?”","You may have mixed up who helped Aladdin; the text says, “The magician had gone back to North Africa… he did not care about Aladdin anymore,” so he gave no help. Instead, rubbing the ring and later the lamp made genies appear who freed him and brought food, servants, and a palace—so the correct answer is the magic ring and lamp.

It shows Aladdin being kind and clever: he gives the Sultan gems and uses the lamp to send “forty servants… each carrying a bowl full of gems,” so “the Sultan agreed that Aladdin could marry his daughter.” That means the main idea is that kindness and cleverness can lead to happiness. Next time, check what the whole story is mostly about, not just one exciting detail.","You successfully identified the story’s message by noticing how Aladdin’s kindness and clever problem-solving lead to a happy ending. The text supports this when he “quickly said, ‘We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!’” and later uses the lamp to meet the Sultan’s challenge, after which “Aladdin was so happy!” and “They celebrated… all day and all night.” Remember to look at what the main character does to solve problems and how the story ends to figure out the theme in similar passages.","You may have thought the story teaches how to find magic lamps, but the text never gives steps; Aladdin meets the genies by accident when he rubs a ring while praying and when his mother cleans a dirty lamp. Instead, the story shows that kind, smart choices lead to good things—he says, “Please bring us something to eat,” meets the Sultan’s challenge with help, and it ends with a happy wedding and feast. Strategy: For main idea questions, ask if the passage is a how-to or a lesson, and check how the story ends.","You may have focused on the “long ago” setting, but the text doesn’t describe real life in the past—there are magical genies and no facts about daily life. Notice how Aladdin kindly asks for food for his mother and cleverly solves the Sultan’s demand with the genie’s help, which leads to a wedding and a palace; this shows the lesson that kindness and cleverness can lead to happiness.

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.""What do you wish for?"" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, ""Take me out of this cave!"" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

---

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.""What is your wish?"" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.

But in the later parts, the lamp genie brings food, forty servants, and even builds a palace—those are not escapes, they are magic solutions to bigger problems. So the best answer is that each part shows Aladdin using magic to solve bigger and bigger problems. Next time, check that your choice fits the whole passage, not just the beginning.","You may have picked “friendship” because it sounds like a common lesson, but the story never shows Aladdin learning about friends. The text repeats that magic fixes his problems: the ring genie frees him from the cave, the lamp genie brings food, and the genie sends 40 servants and builds a palace. So the best answer is that each part shows Aladdin using magic to solve bigger problems. Strategy: When a question says “each part,” look for what happens again and again in the story.","It looks like you focused on the objects, but the story doesn’t show Aladdin finding new magic things each time—he already has the ring and the lamp. The text shows him using their genies to fix bigger problems: the ring genie gets him out of the cave, the lamp genie brings food, and later the lamp genie provides servants and a palace so he can marry the Sultan’s daughter.

Poor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.""What do you wish?"" asked the genie of the ring.""Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,"" Aladdin begged.""I am sorry,"" said the genie. ""I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.""""Then please take me to be with my wife,"" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace. Aladdin and his wife made a plan to get the lamp back.

The next day, the princess cooked a wonderful dinner for the magician. Aladdin hid so the magician could not see him. The princess put poison in the magician's cup. When the magician drank from the cup, he fell down and died.Aladdin ran into the room and looked for the lamp. He found it hidden in the magician's sleeve. Aladdin rubbed the lamp, and the huge genie appeared.""What do you wish?"" the genie of the lamp asked in a loud voice.""Take this palace with everything inside it,"" Aladdin commanded. ""Carry it back to Persia and put it next to the Sultan's home.""""I hear and I obey,"" the genie replied. The palace lifted up into the air and flew away.The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again!

The Sultan isn't jealous of Aladdin. The text shows the Sultan loves his daughter and accepts Aladdin. The Sultan only becomes angry later when the palace disappears, but he isn't the cause of the danger. The magician causes the problems.",This is correct! The passage clearly states: 'The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck' and says 'This must be magic from the lamp!' The magician then 'traveled back to Persia quickly' and created an elaborate disguise and plan to steal the lamp. The magician's jealousy and scheme directly cause all the danger and problems that follow.,This is incorrect. Aladdin doesn't lose the lamp while hunting. He leaves it safely at home. The problem is that the princess doesn't know it's valuable. The magician deliberately tricks her into trading it while Aladdin is away hunting. The lamp isn't accidentally lost - it's stolen through deception.,This is incorrect. The story doesn't say the princess tells people about the lamp or that word spreads.

        Aladdin was very happy with his new life. He thought everything was perfect. But danger was coming. The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck.""That lazy boy?"" the magician said. ""He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!""The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, ""New lamps for old lamps!""Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.""I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,"" she thought.

The princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.""Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,"" the magician commanded. ""Move it to my home in North Africa.""""I hear and I obey,"" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.""Find my daughter right now!"" the Sultan shouted.

These details demonstrate that the lamp mistake created serious danger and distress for multiple characters - the princess, Aladdin, and the Sultan.","This is incorrect.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

---

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

Soon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, ""Who are you?"" Alice felt confused. ""I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today."" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important.

The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” and he “dropped his gloves and fan and ran away,” which shows he was acting worriedly. Remember to look at what a character says and does near the word to choose the best meaning next time.","You may have focused on the word “angry,” but in “Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” the anger belongs to the Duchess, not the Rabbit. The Rabbit says “Oh no!,” gets scared, drops his gloves and fan, and runs away—these are signs he is worried, so “worriedly” is correct. Next time, check which character the feeling belongs to and use action clues to match the emotion.","You may have chosen “silently” because another part says Alice and the Caterpillar stared without speaking, but here “The White Rabbit was talking to himself” and says, “Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!”, so he isn’t silent. Those words show he feels nervous, so “worriedly” is the correct answer. Next time, reread the exact lines about the character and use clue words in the dialogue (like “Oh no!”) to match the feeling.","You may have focused on the Rabbit moving quickly and thought that meant he was acting bravely, but look at “Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” and “he got scared and ran away,” which show he is worried, not brave. The correct answer is worriedly because his words and actions show worry.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash!

You successfully identified a pattern and key details by noticing that Alice changes size whenever she eats or drinks. The text shows this when it says, “She was getting smaller and smaller” after the bottle, “Now I am growing bigger and bigger!” after the cake, and the Caterpillar explains, “One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.” Remember to look for repeated events and cause-and-effect clues (like what happens after she eats or drinks) when answering similar questions.","You may have focused on the line “I can barely see my feet” and turned it into “losing shoes,” but the story never mentions shoes. Instead, it shows a pattern: she shrinks after drinking from the bottle, grows huge after eating the “EAT ME” cake, and later changes size again by eating mushroom pieces. So the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over after eating or drinking. Next time, reread for exact words and look for events that repeat to find the main idea.","You may have focused on the door mix-up and thought she was locked out of a house. But the story says she “was getting smaller,” the cake made her “growing bigger and bigger,” later she was “getting smaller again,” and the Caterpillar explains the mushroom can make her taller or shorter. This shows the main thing that keeps happening is her size changing after she eats or drinks, which is why the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over. Tip: look for what happens again and again to find the best answer.","You may have thought the line “as she spoke” meant she turned invisible, but the text says she is “getting smaller and smaller” and later “growing bigger and bigger”—it never says she disappears. The correct answer is that Alice keeps shrinking and growing after she eats or drinks (bottle, cake, mushroom).

She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

Soon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, ""Who are you?"" Alice felt confused. ""I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today."" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important. ""One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter."" Alice broke off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.",,,,,The author includes the detail about Alice swimming in her own tears to show,MCQ,how Alice's earlier actions lead to later consequences.,that Alice enjoys swimming in unusual places.,why Alice should never cry about her problems.,when Alice learned to control her emotions better.,A,"Correct. This detail connects paragraph 2 (where Alice cries so much 'they made a big pool of water') to paragraph 3 (where 'She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears'). The author deliberately links these sections to show cause and effect - Alice's crying in one part creates a problem she must face in the next part, demonstrating how successive parts build on earlier ones.","Incorrect. Alice does not enjoy swimming in the pool. The text says 'Poor Alice had to swim around' and 'I wish I had not cried so much!' These show discomfort and regret, not enjoyment of unusual swimming.","Incorrect. The author does not present a lesson about never crying. Alice successfully continues her adventure despite crying. The tear pool is part of the fantastical story, not a moral lesson against crying.","Incorrect. The tear pool incident does not show Alice learning to control emotions. She continues to experience strong feelings throughout the story.
