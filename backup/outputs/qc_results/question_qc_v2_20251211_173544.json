This question asks students to infer the magician's motivation from textual evidence, which aligns more closely with RL.3.1 (asking and answering questions, making inferences) or RL.3.3 (character actions and motivations).

In fact, the passage emphasizes that the magician needs someone 'who would follow his directions without asking too many questions' (paragraph 2), suggesting this is a SELECTION criterion, not a TEST during the task. Choice D is also defensible - the magician is deceptive and manipulative, and there's no text explicitly stating he WON'T collect treasures later. The passage doesn't provide enough explicit evidence in paragraph 4 to definitively rule out D or confirm B as the only correct answer.",
