Scientists who study animals put them into different groups. They look at many things about animals. Some scientists check if animals have hair or scales on their skin. They see if animals have live babies or lay eggs. They also check if mothers feed milk to their babies. Scientists want to know if animals are warm-blooded or cold-blooded too.\nOne very important thing scientists study is the animal's backbone. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Humans are vertebrates too! Put your hand on the back of your neck. Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.\n\n---\n\nYour backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.\nMany other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.\n\n---\n\nBut many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.\nSome very interesting invertebrates live in the sea. Lobsters, shrimp, and crabs do not have a backbone. The giant octopus is an invertebrate as well. Have you ever seen a jellyfish or a starfish? They are also invertebrates. All of these animals do not have a backbone or spinal cord.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.3 - Describe the relationship between a series of historical events, scientific ideas or concepts, or steps in technical procedures in a text, using language that pertains to time, sequence, and cause/effect.\n- Question: Why do scientists study whether animals have a backbone?\n- A) Scientists use backbones to group animals into categories.\n- B) Scientists want to see which animals are the biggest.\n- C) Scientists need to count how many bones animals have.\n- D) Scientists want to know how fast animals can run.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RI.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.4 -

Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.\nFish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.\nFish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.\n\n---\n\nLike all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.\nFish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.\n\n---\n\nMost fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.\nSome fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.\n\n---\n\nSalmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.\nAlong the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first. Salmon happen to be one of the tastiest fish of all!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.7 - Use information gained from illustrations (e.g., maps, photographs) and the words in a text to demonstrate understanding of the text (e.g., where, when, why, and how key events occur).\n- Question: Which fact about salmon is clear from the information in the passage?\n- A) Salmon are the only fish that travel in schools.\n- B) Salmon live only in fresh water their whole lives.\n- C) Salmon return to the same stream where they were born.\n- D) Salmon use maps to find their way home.\n- Correct: C\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty easy, CCSS RI.3.7.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.2 - Determine the main idea of a text; recount the key details and explain how they support the main idea.\n- Question: The passage was most likely written to\n- A) explain how fish are different from other animals\n- B) compare fish that live in salt water and fresh water\n- C) tell a story about salmon swimming upstream\n- D) describe the special journey that all fish take\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 3, difficulty medium, CCSS RI.3.2.**\n\nDOK 3 Requirements for siblings:\n- Require strategic thinking and reasoning\n- Analyze, evaluate, or synthesize information\n- Draw conclusions based on multiple pieces of evidence\n- Make complex inferences or connections\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.8 - Describe the logical connection between particular sentences and paragraphs in a text (e.g., comparison, cause/effect, first/second/third in a sequence).\n- Question: Which step occurs after salmon swim to the ocean?\n- A) They are born in fresh water streams\n- B) They form groups called schools\n- C) They develop their sense of smell\n- D) They migrate back to lay their eggs\n- Correct: D\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RI.3.8.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 4 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.5 - Use text features and search tools (e.g., key words, sidebars, hyperlinks) to locate information relevant to a given topic efficiently.\n- Question: This question is connected to the next question you will answer.PART A: A student wants to quickly find information about where fish live.

Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?\nAll living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.\n\n---\n\nPlants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.\nAnimals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.\n\n---\n\nPlants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.\nScientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.\n\n---\n\nWe classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!\nThat's all for now! Rattenborough, over and out! I will be back in the next chapter to tell you more about how animals are sorted into different groups.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.4 -

Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.\nToday, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.\n\n---\n\nMany animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.\nDo you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.\nCrocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.\n\n---\n\nScientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.\nMammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.\nWhen warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?\n\n---\n\nReptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.\nCold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.\nWarm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals. Most crocodiles only eat once a week, but they can live for months without eating!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.2 - Determine the main idea of a text;

He was sitting in the middle of the dusty road. He stared at the motor car as it drove away. Toad went into a kind of dream. His face looked calm and peaceful. He said quietly, \"toot-toot!\" Rat shook him by the shoulder, but Toad did not move at all.\"What a beautiful sight!\" Toad said softly. \"That is the REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel! Oh my! Oh my! I must get one!\" Mole tapped Rat on the shoulder, but Toad kept talking.\"I can't believe I never KNEW about this!\" he said. \"All those years are wasted now. I never knew about motor cars. I never even dreamed about them! But NOW I know. Oh, what fun I will have! What dust clouds will form behind me when I speed down the road! What wagons I will push into the ditch! Those awful little wagons, common wagons, yellow-colored wagons!\"\n\n---\n\n\"What should we do with him?\" asked Mole. \"There is nothing we can do,\" said Rat. \"He has gone mad. He has got a new idea stuck in his head. It is always like this when he starts something new. He will go on like that for days now. He will walk around in a happy dream. He won't be able to do anything useful. Never mind him. Let's go see what we can do about the wagon.\"They looked at the wagon carefully. They found that it would not work anymore. One wheel had been broken into many pieces. \"Come on!\" said Rat. \"We will have to walk. It is five or six miles to the nearest town. The sooner we start walking, the better.\"\"But what about Toad?\" asked Mole. \"We can't leave him here sitting in the middle of the road by himself! It's not safe. What if another motor car comes along?\" \"Never mind him,\" said Rat. \"I'm done with him!\"\n\n---\n\nThey had not walked very far when they heard footsteps behind them. Toad caught up with them. He put his paw inside each of their arms. \"Now, look here Toad!\" said Rat in a sharp voice. \"As soon as we get to the town, you must go straight to the police station. You must see if they know anything about that motor car. You must find out who owns it. You must complain because your wagon is broken. Then, you must go to a blacksmith so he can fix the wagon. Meanwhile, Mole and I will find rooms where we can stay until the wagon is ready.\"\"Police station? Complain?\" said Toad in a dreamy voice. \"Why would I complain about that beautiful motor car? I am done with wagons forever. I never want to see that wagon again or hear about it. Oh, Ratty!\" The animals spent the night in town. The next day, Rat and Mole made their way back to the river bank.\n\n---\n\nA few days later, Mole was sitting on the bank fishing. Rat walked up to him. \"Have you heard the news?\" Rat asked. \"Everyone is talking about it. Toad went to town on the train this morning. He has ordered a large and very expensive motor car.\"\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.1 - Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n- Question: Based on what happened in the story, where should Rat and Mole look the next time they want to find Toad?\n- A) sitting in the middle of the road\n- B) at a motor car dealer in town\n- C) walking along the river bank\n- D) at the police station complaining\n- Correct: B\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.1.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 -

Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean \"both sides of life.\"\nThere are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.\n\n---\n\nLet's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.\nA toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.\n\n---\n\nOnly a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.\nAfter some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.\nIf a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.\n\n---\n\nAfter a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.\nAdult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.\nAmphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water. Now you can see why the Latin meaning of amphibian makes perfect sense!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.3 -

You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.\nReptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.\n\n---\n\nSome people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!\nOther dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.\n\n---\n\nMany people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.\nThe biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.\nCrocodiles have the most powerful bite of all animals. Their bites are ten times stronger than a great white shark's bite. But it is easy to hold a crocodile's mouth closed because they use weak muscles to open their mouths. Even a third grader might be able to hold a crocodile's jaw shut!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.6 -

It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.\nBirds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.\n\n---\n\nLike mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.\nAll birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.\nAll birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.\n\n---\n\nMost birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.\nMost birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.\n\n---\n\nMany birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.\nBirds are famous for their beautiful songs. They sing to attract other birds and to mark their territory. Sometimes birds seem to sing just because they are happy. Maybe they sing to remind us how wonderful and amazing the animal kingdom really is!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.1 -

I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.\nMost scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.\n\n---\n\nTwo amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.\nWhales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.\n\n---\n\nAnother surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.\nHere is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!\n\n---\n\nMammals come in many different shapes and sizes. Some swim in oceans, some fly in the sky, and some walk on land. But all mammals share the same basic things - they have hair, backbones, make milk for their babies, and are warm-blooded. These characteristics help scientists know that an animal is a mammal, no matter how different it might look!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.6 -

You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.\nThe scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.\nZoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.\n\n---\n\nZoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.\nZoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!\n\n---\n\nEverything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!\nEvery day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.\n\n---\n\nToday, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.\nIf you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows? Maybe you will be the first to find a feathered fish or a flying snail. It may sound silly now, but a hundred years ago, nobody knew that whales talked to each other. What will you discover?\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.1 - Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n- Question: Why do zoologists group animals by whether they have a backbone or not?\n- A) to find out which animals are warm-blooded\n- B) to learn which animals breathe with gills\n- C) to discover which animals feed milk to babies\n- D) to see how they are the same and different\n- Correct: D\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty easy, CCSS RI.3.1.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.3 - Describe the relationship between a series of historical events, scientific ideas or concepts, or steps in technical procedures in a text, using language that pertains to time, sequence, and cause/effect.\n- Question: What must happen before scientists can group animals into vertebrates and invertebrates?\n- A) Scientists must find out which animals are warm-blooded and cold-blooded.\n- B) Scientists must observe animals to see how they are the same and different.\n- C) Scientists must study how animal babies are born and cared for.\n- D) Scientists must study different body parts called organs that help animals breathe.\n- Correct: B\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 3, difficulty medium, CCSS RI.3.3.**\n\nDOK 3 Requirements for siblings:\n- Require strategic thinking and reasoning\n- Analyze, evaluate, or synthesize information\n- Draw conclusions based on multiple pieces of evidence\n- Make complex inferences or connections\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.4 - Determine the meaning of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases in a text relevant to a grade 3 topic or subject area.\n- Question: Read this sentence.

A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.\nGoodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.\n\n---\n\nWhen Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!\nAfter finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.\n\n---\n\nMore importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.\nGoodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.\n\n---\n\nGoodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.\nShe loves working with young people and teaching them how to protect animals. She has written many books and has won many awards for her work. Even when she was 79 years old, she was still working to spread the message that animals need our protection!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.6 - Distinguish their own point of view from that of the author of a text.\n- Question: Someone might read this passage to\n- A) persuade others to protect animals.\n- B) learn facts about Jane Goodall.\n- C) enjoy a story about chimpanzees.\n- D) learn how to become a scientist.\n- Correct: B\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RI.3.6.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.5 - Use text features and search tools (e.g., key words, sidebars, hyperlinks) to locate information relevant to a given topic efficiently.\n- Question: What is the most likely purpose for including the detailed description of how chimps use grass to catch termites?\n- A) to prove that chimps are better at using tools than humans\n- B) to demonstrate that chimps mostly prefer insects over other types of food\n- C) to provide evidence that supports the discovery about chimp intelligence\n- D) to show that termites are an important food source for chimpanzees\n- Correct: C\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 3, difficulty easy, CCSS RI.3.5.**\n\nDOK 3 Requirements for siblings:\n- Require strategic thinking and reasoning\n- Analyze, evaluate, or synthesize information\n- Draw conclusions based on multiple pieces of evidence\n- Make complex inferences or connections\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.2 - Determine the main idea of a text; recount the key details and explain how they support the main idea.\n- Question: In the passage about Jane Goodall, she made many important discoveries about chimpanzees.

People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.\nThe deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.\n\n---\n\nHow deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.\nNo land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.\n\n---\n\nWith lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.\nNo sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.\n\n---\n\nHumans have only explored a tiny part of the deep seas. There are still many creatures waiting to be discovered. If you want to discover new ocean animals, you might want to become a marine biologist. A marine biologist is a scientist who studies ocean life and explores the mysteries of the deep sea.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.1 - Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n- Question: Read the sentence from the passage.

They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.\nThe American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.\n\n---\n\nAmerican tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.\nIf you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.\n\n---\n\nLike other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it. Their favorite spot is on a tree branch that has fallen into a pond. Tree frogs have been around for a very long time. They lived on Earth even before dinosaurs! You can find different types of tree frogs in North America, South America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.\nMost tree frogs like a warm, wet climate. If you live where tree frogs are found, you are lucky! In the summer, you can fall asleep listening to the sounds of many tree frogs singing together. It sounds like a beautiful orchestra of nature.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.1 - Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n- Question: Why do American green tree frogs have suction cups on their toes?\n- A) to help them catch small bugs\n- B) to help them stick to things they climb\n- C) to help them make loud noises\n- D) to help them breathe underwater\n- Correct: B\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty easy, CCSS RI.3.1.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.6 -

A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.\nThese special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.\n\n---\n\nA Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!\nLike many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.\n\n---\n\nKomodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!\nYoung Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.\n\n---\n\nYou never want a Komodo dragon to bite you or even lick you! Their saliva is full of dangerous germs that can make people very sick. The saliva in their mouth contains bacteria that can be deadly. The safest way to see a Komodo dragon is at a zoo. Only very brave scientists should get close to them in the wild!\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.6 -

These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.\nBeavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.\n\n---\n\nBeavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say \"busy as a beaver\" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.\nWhen beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.\n\n---\n\nOne beaver family can change the land around them in big ways. Their dams make the water in rivers rise higher. This floods the land nearby and creates a swamp called a wetland. A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.\nBeavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave. Beavers are also very territorial. This means they don't want other beavers living in their space. They want to keep all the tasty tree bark for themselves! They will fight other beavers who try to move into their area. Beavers are truly amazing animals to watch and learn about.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, hard):\n- Standard: RI.3.5 - Use text features and search tools (e.g., key words, sidebars, hyperlinks) to locate information relevant to a given topic efficiently.\n- Question: According to the passage about beavers, what do beavers need to build their dams and lodges?\n- A) pelts from other animals\n- B) sharp teeth and flat tails\n- C) deep water from ponds and lakes\n- D) trees they gnaw down with their teeth\n- Correct: D\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty hard, CCSS RI.3.5.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.1 -

While the passage mentions that scientists check if animals have hair or scales, it does not say that all mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds share this trait. In fact, mammals have hair while reptiles and fish have scales, so this is not something they all have in common.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect.
