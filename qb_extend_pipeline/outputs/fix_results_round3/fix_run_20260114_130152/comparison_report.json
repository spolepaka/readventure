In fact, William specifically mentions that the Powhatan 'can catch more fish in one day than we catch in a whole week,' making the claim that colonists think they are better at fishing contradictory to the text.",
          "specificity_balance": "The choices vary significantly in specificity. Option A is broad and conceptual ('obstacles to land use'), while options B and D focus on very specific skills (hunting vs. farming, hunting vs. fishing). This creates an imbalance in the level of detail across choices.",

It requires the reader to interpret the character perspectives based on the provided passage, which may be complicated for this grade level. The vocabulary includes terms like 'obstacles,' 'colonists,' and 'skills,' which might require additional contextual understanding.

          "too_close": "Choice C ('Getting trees and metal takes away animal homes') and choice B ('Getting oil and coal can cause accidents like oil spills') both imply a negative environmental impact associated with extracting natural resources. While B specifically addresses oil spills (a key point in the passage), C also aligns with the idea of environmental harm, which could confuse a Grade 3 student lacking detailed knowledge of energy production and its impacts.",
          "difficulty_assessment": "The question requires understanding the environmental impacts of different natural resources, which may be abstract for Grade 3 students. The vocabulary, such as 'accidents', 'natural resource', and the concepts of energy production and environmental implications, may be challenging without explicit context provided in the passage. Moreover, the connection between cleaner ways to make electricity and protecting the environment is not directly covered by the passage, increasing the reasoning demands for this age group.",
