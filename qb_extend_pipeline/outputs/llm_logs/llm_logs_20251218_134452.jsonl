His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. \"Tell me, young man,\" said the stranger. \"Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?\"\"Yes, I am,\" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. \"My dear nephew!\" he cried out. \"Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!\"\n\n---\n\nAladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. \"Come with me today,\" he said to the boy. \"I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city.\" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.\"Go gather some dry sticks,\" the magician told Aladdin. \"We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.\"Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.\n\n---\n\n\"Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,\" said the magician. \"It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.\"Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.\"Take this special ring,\" said the magician. \"It will keep you safe from any harm.\" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.\"Give me your hand, Uncle,\" Aladdin called out. \"Help me climb out!\"\"First, hand me the lamp,\" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. \"I cannot reach it right now,\" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him \"richer than any king in the world.\"What does this phrase mean?\n- A) Aladdin will have more money than he can count\n- B) Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom\n- C) Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave\n- D) Aladdin will meet kings from other countries\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.4.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What causes the magician to trap Aladdin in the cave?\n- A) Aladdin doesn't give him the lamp right away.\n- B) Aladdin won't to go into the cave.\n- C) Aladdin takes too many gems from the cave.\n- D) Aladdin breaks the magic ring on his finger.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 3, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

The text says he 'spoke magical words' and then 'the earth split open,' which means magic caused the ground to open, not physical digging.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The text explains that after Aladdin's father died, 'Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.' This phrase means she needed to do challenging work to get the money they needed to survive. The phrase 'work hard' is literal language meaning to put in great effort at a job.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text does not say she became a tailor. It says his father 'worked as a tailor,' but we do not know what job the mother did. The phrase means she had to do difficult work, not specifically tailoring.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. 'Work hard to earn money' means doing a job to get paid, not asking for money. Earning means getting money by working, which is different from asking people to give you money.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text does not mention her traveling anywhere.

The text shows the magician 'only cared about getting the magic lamp' and when Aladdin could not hand it over right away, 'He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place.

Giving Aladdin the ring might seem helpful, but the text explains the magician 'needed someone to help him' get the lamp. He protected Aladdin only so the boy could complete the task, not because he truly cared about helping him.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The text shows the magician 'was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' but pretended to be family. He 'wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions.' By lying about being family, he gained trust so Aladdin would obey him and go into the cave. This deception at the beginning leads directly to Aladdin being trapped when he cannot immediately give the lamp.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician does not teach Aladdin any magic. The text shows the magician performed magic himself and gave Aladdin a protective ring, but he never taught the boy how to use spells. Aladdin gets trapped because of the magician's impatience, not incorrect magic use.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician did not force Aladdin to take gems. The text says 'Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want,' giving Aladdin permission. Aladdin chose to fill his bag with gems, which made it heavy, but the magician's impatience about getting the lamp caused the trapping.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The text explains that 'To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.' The magician chose Aladdin because he could manipulate a poor boy into obeying him completely.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The text states 'The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp.' When Aladdin needed help climbing out, the magician demanded the lamp first. When Aladdin could not give it immediately, the magician 'spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place,' trapping him. A person who truly wanted to help Aladdin become wealthy would have helped him out of the cave, but instead the magician abandoned him when he did not get what he wanted.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The magician's offer to make Aladdin rich seemed wonderful, but the text reveals 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp.'
