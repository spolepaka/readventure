The dramatic setting description could mislead students who conflate adventurous or exotic settings with the fantasy genre itself.\n\n**Choice D: \"Aladdin gathers dry sticks for a fire\"**\nThis is plausible because it's part of the magical ritual sequence. Students who don't fully understand genre might think any action leading to magic is itself fantastical, or they might focus on this being part of the \"amazing\" thing the magician promises to show.\n\nAll three incorrect choices represent reasonable misconceptions about what makes a story fantasy.
