His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. \"Tell me, young man,\" said the stranger. \"Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?\"\"Yes, I am,\" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. \"My dear nephew!\" he cried out. \"Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!\"\n\n---\n\nAladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. \"Come with me today,\" he said to the boy. \"I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city.\" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.\"Go gather some dry sticks,\" the magician told Aladdin. \"We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.\"Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.\n\n---\n\n\"Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,\" said the magician. \"It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.\"Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.\"Take this special ring,\" said the magician. \"It will keep you safe from any harm.\" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.\"Give me your hand, Uncle,\" Aladdin called out. \"Help me climb out!\"\"First, hand me the lamp,\" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. \"I cannot reach it right now,\" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him \"richer than any king in the world.\"What does this phrase mean?\n- A) Aladdin will have more money than he can count\n- B) Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom\n- C) Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave\n- D) Aladdin will meet kings from other countries\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.4.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What causes the magician to trap Aladdin in the cave?\n- A) Aladdin doesn't give him the lamp right away.\n- B) Aladdin won't to go into the cave.\n- C) Aladdin takes too many gems from the cave.\n- D) Aladdin breaks the magic ring on his finger.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 3, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

The text shows that after the magician's magic words, 'the earth split open right at their feet' revealing a stone covering treasure below. This phrase means the ground broke apart to show what was underneath. This figurative language helps readers visualize the magical moment.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text never says the magician fell anywhere. The phrase describes what happened to the ground itself after the magical spell, not what happened to a person. Reread paragraph 3 to see what the splitting earth revealed.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While earthquakes do split the earth, this splitting was caused by magic, not a natural earthquake. The text shows the magician spoke 'magical words' that made this happen. The phrase describes a magical event, not a natural disaster.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The stone remained whole - Aladdin later pulled it up by its ring. The phrase 'earth split open' describes what happened to the ground around the stone, not to the stone itself.

The magician specifically did NOT want someone who would ask questions. The phrase 'without asking too many questions' shows he wanted the opposite - someone who wouldn't ask for explanations. This shows the magician wanted control, not collaboration.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The text explains the magician 'wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions.' This phrase means he needed someone who would simply do what he said without questioning his motives. This reveals the magician's manipulative nature and helps readers understand why he chose young Aladdin.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician already knew about the lamp - he traveled from North Africa to find it. He needed someone to help him GET the lamp, not teach him about it. The phrase shows he wanted obedience, not knowledge-sharing.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician had no intention of sharing. The phrase describes the TYPE of person he wanted (obedient), not what he planned to do with the treasure. Later events prove he only wanted the lamp for himself.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 2's character motivation using phrase about obedience - differs from reference which asks about wealth comparison in paragraph 4\",\"quality_verification\":{\"homogeneity_check\":\"all choices describe types of helpers or relationships the magician wanted\",\"specificity_check\":\"all describe specific behaviors or roles\",\"length_check\":\"A: 8 words, B: 9 words, C: 8 words, D: 8 words - balanced within 12%\",\"semantic_distance_check\":\"asking/obeying/teaching/sharing are distinct relationship types\",\"single_correct_check\":\"only B matches the text's explanation of what the magician sought\",\"diversity_check\":\"targets paragraph 2 motivation phrase - completely different from reference's paragraph 4 wealth metaphor and other variants\"}},{\"question\":\"According to the story, what does 'sweet-smelling perfumes' reveal about the magician's spell?\",\"option_1\":\"The spell required special ingredients to work\",\"option_2\":\"The magician wanted the fire to smell nice\",\"option_3\":\"Aladdin needed to breathe the perfume\",\"option_4\":\"The perfumes helped them stay warm\",\"correct_answer\":\"A\",\"option_1_explanation\":\"Correct! The text shows the magician 'threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words' as part of his spell. This phrase tells readers that the perfumes were necessary ingredients for the magic to work, not just decoration. This detail helps readers understand how complex magic spells operate in this story.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician wasn't concerned about pleasant smells - he was performing serious magic. The text shows the perfumes were part of the spell itself, thrown into the fire along with magical words. The purpose was magical, not decorative.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests Aladdin needed to breathe or smell the perfumes. They were thrown into the fire, not given to Aladdin. Review paragraph 3 to see how the perfumes were used in the magic ritual.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. They already had a fire for warmth. The text shows the perfumes were specifically part of the magical spell that split the earth open, not for temperature control. The timing shows they were connected to the magic, not comfort.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 3's spell-casting details using sensory description - differs from reference which asks about wealth metaphor\",\"quality_verification\":{\"homogeneity_check\":\"all choices explain purposes or functions of the perfumes\",\"specificity_check\":\"all provide concrete reasons for using perfumes\",\"length_check\":\"A: 7 words, B: 8 words, C: 6 words, D: 6 words - balanced within 25%\",\"semantic_distance_check\":\"spell ingredients/smell/breathing/warmth are clearly distinct purposes\",\"single_correct_check\":\"only A aligns with magical ritual context in paragraph 3\",\"diversity_check\":\"targets paragraph 3 spell ingredients - different from reference and all other variants focusing on different text sections\"}},{\"question\":\"What does it mean when the text says the stranger 'threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight'?\",\"option_1\":\"The stranger pushed Aladdin to the ground\",\"option_2\":\"The stranger gave Aladdin a strong embrace\",\"option_3\":\"The stranger handed Aladdin some gifts\",\"option_4\":\"The stranger pointed at Aladdin's arms\",\"correct_answer\":\"B\",\"option_1_explanation\":\"Incorrect. 'Threw his arms around' doesn't mean pushing - it means wrapping arms around someone. The phrase describes an affectionate gesture, not a violent one. The magician was pretending to be happy to see his 'nephew,' not attacking him.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The phrase 'threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight' is figurative language meaning the stranger gave Aladdin a strong, tight hug. This gesture was part of the magician's act to pretend he was Aladdin's loving uncle. Understanding this phrase helps readers see how the magician was deceiving the family with fake affection.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text specifically says 'hugged him tight,' which describes physical embrace, not giving objects. 'Threw his arms around' means wrapped his arms around Aladdin's body. No gifts are mentioned in this scene.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. 'Threw his arms around' doesn't mean pointing. This is figurative language for hugging, where 'threw' shows the quick, enthusiastic motion of embracing someone.

After the stranger tells Aladdin 'Your father was my brother' and calls him 'my dear nephew,' Aladdin brings him home. The text shows Aladdin believed the stranger's claim to be family, which motivated him to introduce the man to his mother. This action moves the plot forward by bringing the deceiver into their home.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. At this point in the story, the stranger hasn't mentioned magic at all - that comes later. In paragraph 1, he only claims to be family. The magic happens much later on the mountain. Reread the order of events carefully.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin doesn't receive the magic ring until much later, in paragraph 4, after they climb the mountain. In paragraph 1, Aladdin brings the stranger home simply because the man claimed to be his uncle. Check the sequence of events.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. No bags are mentioned in this part of the story. Aladdin brings the stranger home in paragraph 1, but he doesn't get bags of gems until paragraph 5, after going into the cave. This answer confuses the timeline of events.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 1 immediate cause-effect relationship of meeting and bringing home - differs from reference which asks about cave entrapment cause\",\"quality_verification\":{\"homogeneity_check\":\"all choices are reasons or motivations for bringing someone home\",\"specificity_check\":\"all provide specific motivations for the action\",\"length_check\":\"A: 9 words, B: 8 words, C: 9 words, D: 8 words - balanced within 11%\",\"semantic_distance_check\":\"family claim/magic teaching/showing ring/carrying bags are distinct motivations\",\"single_correct_check\":\"only A matches the textual evidence from paragraph 1\",\"diversity_check\":\"targets paragraph 1 meeting scene motivation - completely different from reference's paragraph 5 cave conflict\"}},{\"question\":\"How does the magician's promise to help Aladdin 'become a merchant and earn good money' affect what happens?\",\"option_1\":\"It makes Aladdin refuse to go with him the next day.\",\"option_2\":\"It convinces the mother to let Aladdin go with the stranger.\",\"option_3\":\"It causes Aladdin to ask too many questions about magic.\",\"option_4\":\"It makes the mother tell the stranger to leave their home.\",\"correct_answer\":\"B\",\"option_1_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The opposite happens - Aladdin DOES go with the magician the next morning. The text shows that in paragraph 3, Aladdin follows the magician's instructions to climb the mountain. The promise worked to gain trust, not create refusal.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! Paragraph 2 states: 'When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.' This promise made the mother trust the stranger, which allowed him to take Aladdin away the next day. This cause-and-effect relationship shows how the magician's deception worked to gain access to Aladdin.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text tells us the magician specifically wanted someone who WOULDN'T ask too many questions, and Aladdin fit this description. Throughout the story, Aladdin follows directions without questioning. The promise didn't make him ask more questions.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The mother welcomed the stranger into their home BECAUSE of his promise.

Aladdin has no knowledge of the lamp before meeting the magician. Paragraph 2 explains the magician came from North Africa searching for the lamp - Aladdin didn't know about it. The magician chose Aladdin for a different reason related to his personality.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While Aladdin is poor, this isn't why the magician selected him. Paragraph 2 specifically states the magician 'wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions.' Poverty made Aladdin vulnerable, but obedience was the key factor.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct! Paragraph 2 clearly explains: 'He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.' The magician analyzed Aladdin's character and chose him because he would be obedient and unquestioning. This motivation drives the entire plot.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin has no special powers. The magician gives Aladdin a protective ring later, but Aladdin himself has no magical abilities.

The text explains that when Aladdin says 'I will give it to him after climbing out,' the impatient magician can't wait and 'spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place.' Aladdin's decision to wait to hand over the lamp - even though it was reasonable - directly causes the magician to trap him. This shows how the magician's impatience and selfishness create the conflict.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The brass ring stays intact. Aladdin successfully 'pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring' earlier. The ring wasn't broken - the problem was that Aladdin couldn't reach the lamp in his heavy bag while climbing. Review paragraph 5 for the actual cause.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Time wasn't the issue. The text shows Aladdin successfully gathered gems and found the lamp. The problem occurred when he was already back at the cave opening but couldn't immediately hand over the lamp.

This detail directly demonstrates the story's warning about strangers.

His heavy bag causes a practical problem, but this doesn't convey the story's lesson about greed causing harm.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The magician's overwhelming greed for the lamp's power drives the entire plot. His greed makes him so impatient that when Aladdin can't immediately produce the lamp, the magician traps him rather than helping him out first. The text shows 'the impatient magician could not wait any longer' and sealed Aladdin inside, demonstrating how excessive desire for wealth caused the magician to harm an innocent boy.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The magician made beautiful promises about helping him 'become a merchant and earn good money,' but these promises hid his selfish plan to use Aladdin to get the lamp.

The story's lesson is about deception and trust, not about the value of honest labor.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician falsely claimed to be family but betrayed Aladdin terribly by trapping him. This actually teaches the opposite lesson - that someone claiming to be family may not be trustworthy.

The magical spell demonstrates the magician's power but doesn't convey the lesson about caution with strangers.

The magician has no nephew - this was a complete lie. Paragraph 2 clearly states 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.' He invented the family connection as part of his plan.

The magician already has magical powers from North Africa - he doesn't need to learn from Aladdin's family. In fact, paragraph 2 says he's 'a powerful magician' who came TO Persia with his knowledge.

Paragraph 2 shows that when he 'promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant,' the mother 'believed his words.' This trust allowed him to take Aladdin to the mountain the next day.

This connection between deception and achieving his goal shows strategic manipulation.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician already knew where the lamp was before meeting Aladdin - that's why he traveled from North Africa to this specific location. He needed Aladdin to RETRIEVE the lamp, not to show him where it was. The false family claim served a different purpose.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

Multiple actions reveal this character trait: He lies about being Aladdin's uncle (paragraph 1), deceives the mother with false promises (paragraph 2), manipulates Aladdin into dangerous cave retrieval (paragraph 4), and ultimately traps him rather than helping (paragraph 5).

The entire story illustrates this message through cause and effect. The magician's promise that finding the lamp would make Aladdin 'richer than any king' seemed too good to be true - and it was.
