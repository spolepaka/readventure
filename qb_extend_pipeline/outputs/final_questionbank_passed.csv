Next time, stick to the exact words and look for clue phrases about the main idea, like “very rich.”","You may have focused on the word “king” and guessed he’d meet kings, but the text never says Aladdin will meet any kings; it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the treasure “will make you richer than any king in the world.” That evidence points to the correct answer: Aladdin will have more money than he can count.

This shows the real lesson is to be careful about trusting strangers who make big promises. Next time, check that your answer matches what happens in the whole story, especially the results of the characters’ actions.","You successfully identified the lesson by noticing how a stranger’s big promises led to trouble. The text supports this when the man promises to help Aladdin “learn to become a merchant and earn good money” and says the treasure will make him “richer than any king in the world,” but then he traps Aladdin in the cave.

Toad's enthusiastic statement 'This is the real life for a gentleman!' shows he is enjoying himself, not feeling let down. The exclamation mark and positive words like 'real life' indicate satisfaction and pleasure, which are opposite to disappointment. His physical action of stretching out suggests comfort, not dissatisfaction.","This is correct. The passage describes Toad 'stretching out his legs' which is a physical sign of relaxation and comfort. His declaration 'This is the real life for a gentleman!' expresses contentment and satisfaction with the experience. The context shows this happens during the pleasant part of their journey when 'Everything was going well,' confirming Toad feels at ease and happy.","This is incorrect. Toad's statement comes during the calm, pleasant portion of the trip before the motor car appears. The text describes birds singing, other travelers being friendly, and 'a pleasant trip,' not anything scary. Fear comes later when the motor car suddenly appears, but Toad's relaxed stretching and positive words show he feels safe and content at this moment.","This is incorrect. Toad's clear, confident statement about 'the real life for a gentleman' shows he understands and appreciates what is happening. There is nothing in his words or actions that suggests uncertainty or bewilderment. Instead, his stretching and enthusiastic declaration demonstrate he feels sure this lifestyle suits him perfectly.",3,RL.3.7,3,extended,0.82,True,7bbcea3709b3,7bbcea3709b3,True,quiz_302082,,,

Curiosity involves wanting to learn or know more about something. Rat's behavior of 'dancing up and down in the road' and 'shaking both fists in the air' while shouting 'You bad people!' shows intense anger, not interest in learning about the motor car or its drivers.","This is incorrect. Pride involves feeling satisfaction or pleasure in oneself or others. The passage shows Rat calling the drivers 'bad people' and 'mean drivers' and threatening to 'call the police,' which are expressions of outrage and anger, not pride. His aggressive gestures demonstrate he is upset, not pleased.","This is correct. The passage states 'Rat was very angry' directly. His actions support this: he 'danced up and down in the road,' shook 'both fists in the air,' and shouted insults like 'You bad people!' and 'You road hogs!' His threat to report them to police shows intense anger. All these details demonstrate Rat feels furious about what happened to their wagon.","This is incorrect. Nervous means feeling worried or anxious. Rat's aggressive actions of shaking fists, shouting, and threatening to call police show he feels bold and confrontational, not timid or worried. The text emphasizes his anger through words like 'very angry' and aggressive behaviors, not signs of nervousness.",3,RL.3.7,3,extended,0.82,True,edd83ad163ae,edd83ad163ae,True,quiz_302082,,,

The passage describes the sound as 'faint' and coming from 'a small cloud of dust' in the distance. The comparison to 'an animal in pain' suggests the sound was strange and unclear. After hearing it, 'They turned to keep talking to each other,' showing they didn't understand what it was or didn't think it was important. This behavior indicates confusion or puzzlement about the unusual sound.","This is incorrect. Excitement involves enthusiasm and eager anticipation. The friends' reaction of simply turning back to their conversation shows they didn't recognize the sound as something thrilling. If they were excited, they would have stopped to investigate or commented on it. Instead, they dismissed it and continued talking, suggesting they were unsure what to make of it.","This is incorrect. Boredom means feeling uninterested or weary. While the friends did turn back to talking, this doesn't indicate boredom with the sound. The strange nature of the sound 'like an animal in pain' would catch attention rather than bore them. Their turning away shows they didn't understand its significance, not that they found it dull.","This is incorrect. Delight means great pleasure or joy. Nothing in the text suggests the friends felt happy about hearing a faint sound 'like an animal in pain.' This description creates an unsettling image, not a pleasant one. Their casual reaction of returning to conversation shows they didn't find it particularly pleasing or recognize what it meant.",3,RL.3.7,3,extended,0.91,True,988f88313a23,988f88313a23,True,quiz_302082,,,

Respectful means showing polite regard for someone. Rat calls the drivers 'bad people,' 'mean drivers,' and 'road hogs,' which are insults showing disrespect. His threat to 'call the police' and 'report you' demonstrates he thinks they deserve punishment, not respect. These actions are the opposite of being respectful.","This is correct. Outraged means feeling shocked and very angry about something unjust. The passage shows Rat 'danced up and down in the road' and shook 'both fists in the air' - intense physical expressions of anger. His shouted insults and threats show he feels the drivers acted wrongly and unfairly, causing unjust harm. The text directly states 'Rat was very angry,' confirming his outrage.","This is incorrect. Peaceful means calm and tranquil. Rat's violent gestures of dancing up and down while shaking both fists show he is highly agitated, not calm. His loud shouting and angry words like 'You bad people!' demonstrate intense emotional disturbance, which is the opposite of feeling peaceful.","This is incorrect. Cheerful means happy and in good spirits. The passage emphasizes Rat's anger through direct statement ('Rat was very angry') and through his hostile actions and words. Nothing about shouting insults, shaking fists, and threatening to call police suggests happiness.
