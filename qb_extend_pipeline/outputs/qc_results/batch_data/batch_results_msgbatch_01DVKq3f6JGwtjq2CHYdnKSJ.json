        "score": 1,
        "response": "All distractors are plausible given the magician's initial behavior. Choice B could be believed since he claimed to be Aladdin's uncle and promised to help him. Choice C seems plausible as he promised to help Aladdin become a merchant and earn money. Choice D aligns with his stated intention to introduce Aladdin to merchants and show him valuable items. None are obviously wrong without careful reading of the entire passage.",

Each includes: (1) the magician's action/intention toward Aladdin, and (2) the ultimate purpose involving the lamp, treasures, or his stated goals.

        "response": "RL.3.2 requires students to recount stories and determine the central message, lesson, or moral. This question directly assesses this standard by asking students to analyze evidence throughout the entire story to determine the magician's true plan (central plot element), requiring them to distinguish between what the magician claimed versus his actual intentions - a key comprehension skill for understanding the story's meaning.",

The phrase 'from the very beginning' clearly indicates students should identify the magician's original intention, and 'based on evidence throughout the story' directs students to use textual support.

The passage explicitly states the magician 'was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' but 'a powerful magician' who came to find 'a special magic lamp' and 'needed someone to help him.' The text clearly shows his deception ('He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions') and that he only cared about the lamp ('He only cared about getting the magic lamp'). No other answer is defensible given the textual evidence.",
