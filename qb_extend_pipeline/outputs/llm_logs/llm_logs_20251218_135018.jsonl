The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.\"What do you wish for?\" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, \"Take me out of this cave!\" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.\n\n---\n\n\"This lamp is so dirty,\" said Aladdin's mother. \"Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food.\" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.\"What is your wish?\" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, \"We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!\" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.\n\n---\n\nOne day, Aladdin told his mother, \"I want to marry the Sultan's daughter.\" His mother laughed. \"Have you lost your mind?\" she said. \"Your father was just a poor tailor!\" But Aladdin said, \"Remember those shiny gems from the cave? Take them as a gift to the Sultan.\"Aladdin's mother went to see the Sultan. \"My lord,\" she said, \"my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter.\" The Sultan laughed loudly. \"Your son and my daughter? That's silly!\" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.\"These are amazing!\" the Sultan thought. \"I have never seen such beautiful gems!\" Then the Sultan said, \"Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.\"\n\n---\n\nWhen Aladdin heard this, he rubbed his magic lamp. The genie appeared right away. Aladdin told the genie what the Sultan wanted. Almost instantly, the genie brought forty servants. Each servant carried a large golden bowl. Half the bowls were filled with pearls and diamonds. The other bowls were filled with rubies and emeralds.The Sultan was amazed by all the treasure. He agreed that Aladdin could marry his daughter. Aladdin was so happy! He rubbed the lamp again. The genie appeared and prepared a wedding fit for a prince. The servants brought Aladdin fine clothes and sweet perfumes. They gave him a beautiful horse to ride. They even built him a palace right next to the Sultan's palace. They rolled out a thick red carpet from the Sultan's home to Aladdin's new palace. When the Sultan saw the magnificent palace, he knew Aladdin was perfect for his daughter. They celebrated with a wonderful feast, music, and dancing that lasted all day and all night.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: How does Aladdin most likely feel when he sees the forty servants with bowls of gems?\n- A) happy\n- B) angry\n- C) worried\n- D) scared\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty hard, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

The passage states that when 'Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down,' Aladdin quickly responded by saying 'We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!'

The text doesn't mention the Sultan wondering about Aladdin's home. Focus on what the Sultan actually does right after seeing the gems in paragraph 3.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The passage clearly shows this change: 'The Sultan laughed loudly' at first, but then 'when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.' This demonstrates how his dismissive attitude shifted to serious interest when he saw the valuable gems.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The Sultan doesn't show worry in the text. Instead, he becomes interested in the gems and sets a challenge.

Aladdin wasn't trying to clean the ring. The text explains a different reason for his hand movement. Look at what Aladdin was doing with his hands in paragraph 1.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The passage states: 'Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger.' This shows that Aladdin rubbed the ring accidentally while praying, not on purpose. He didn't know the ring was magical at this point in the story.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin called out to his 'uncle' earlier but got no answer. The ring rubbing happened for a different reason. Reread the beginning of paragraph 1 carefully.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The text shows this bravery: 'Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, \\\"We are very hungry!

Earlier with the ring genie, the text also notes 'Aladdin was scared, but he said' his wish, showing courage despite fear.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

While magic helps Aladdin, the story emphasizes how he uses the objects thoughtfully, not just that he possesses them. The central message is deeper than simply having magic.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! Throughout the story, Aladdin succeeds by using the resources he has wisely. He cleverly uses the ring genie to escape, the lamp genie to get food and wealth, and the gems to impress the Sultan. Each time, he thinks about what he needs and uses his magical items purposefully. The story shows that being clever with what you have leads to good outcomes, which is conveyed through Aladdin's successful use of the ring, lamp, and gems.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story actually shows the opposite - the magician abandons Aladdin, and Aladdin must rely on his own resourcefulness with the magical objects to succeed.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The story demonstrates this message through key details: Aladdin shows courage by speaking to scary genies when others are frightened, and quick thinking by knowing what to ask for at each moment. He escapes the cave by accidentally activating the ring, cleverly gets food when hungry, and strategically fulfills the Sultan's challenge. These examples of bravery and smart decisions transform him from a poor tailor's son trapped in a cave to a prince in a palace, conveying the central message that courage and cleverness lead to success.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story actually shows distrust - the magician pretends to be Aladdin's uncle but betrays him. Family trust is not the main lesson being taught.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While genies help, the story focuses on how Aladdin uses them wisely, not that magic solves everything automatically. The central message is about personal qualities, not magic.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

Aladdin doesn't give up in the cave - he keeps trying different approaches (yelling, crying, praying) until something works. The story teaches the opposite of giving up.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. When the magician abandons him, Aladdin doesn't wait passively. He takes action himself by praying and accidentally activating the ring. Review what Aladdin does in the cave.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct! The story conveys this message through Aladdin's persistence in the cave: 'First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray.' Each attempt represents a different approach, and his continued efforts eventually lead to rubbing the ring and escaping. Later, he persists by sending his mother to the Sultan, then meeting the challenge with forty servants. Key details show that not giving up and trying various solutions ultimately brings success.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

This detail shows the Sultan's desire for wealth, but doesn't demonstrate that cleverness is more valuable. Look for examples of smart thinking leading to success.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! This detail conveys the moral about cleverness being valuable. The text shows Aladdin making strategic decisions: using the ring genie to escape the cave, using the lamp genie to get food when hungry, and later using it again to fulfill the Sultan's challenge and prepare for the wedding. His intelligent choices about when and how to use his magical resources demonstrate that thinking wisely is more important than simply having valuable objects.

The magician's journey shows determination but not the moral about cleverness versus riches. Focus on how Aladdin uses smart thinking throughout the story.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The author's purpose isn't to generalize about all mothers. The scene serves a specific purpose in this story. Think about what this moment adds to the reader's experience.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The author writes 'a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one' and describes how 'Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down' to help readers understand just how impressive and powerful the lamp's genie is.

This distinguishes the lamp's genie from the ring's genie and builds anticipation for what this powerful genie can do.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The author describes Aladdin using magic to help others and fulfill the Sultan's challenge fairly, not showing greed. Notice how the story portrays Aladdin's actions positively.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! Throughout the story, the author uses positive language about Aladdin's journey: he 'was so happy,' the wedding was 'fit for a prince,' and they 'celebrated with a wonderful feast.' The author describes how 'the Sultan knew Aladdin was perfect for his daughter' and includes details about the magnificent palace and celebration. These word choices guide readers to view Aladdin's marriage positively and feel he has earned this happy ending, which is different from simply describing events neutrally.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The author focuses on Aladdin's success and happiness, not on hardship or pity. The genie makes tasks easy for him. Reread how the author describes the ending.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The author creates contrast between characters by showing their different reactions to the same situation. When the huge genie appears, 'Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down,' but 'Aladdin quickly said' his wish to the genie. This difference in their responses - one fearful, one brave - helps readers understand that Aladdin has courage and composure that his mother lacks, distinguishing their character traits clearly.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The author mentions Aladdin's fine clothes at the end but doesn't compare his clothing to his mother's to show character differences. Look for how their behaviors differ.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The author doesn't mention their ages to show differences. Focus on how the author contrasts their actions and reactions in key moments.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The author specifically writes that the genie 'built him a palace right next to the Sultan's palace' and 'rolled out a thick red carpet from the Sultan's home to Aladdin's new palace.' By placing Aladdin's palace beside the Sultan's and connecting them with a royal red carpet, the author shows that Aladdin has risen to the same level as the Sultan. This physical equality of the palaces represents Aladdin's social transformation from a poor tailor's son to someone worthy of marrying the princess.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The author doesn't discuss how long buildings last. The palace descriptions serve a different purpose in showing Aladdin's new position. Think about what the palace location and connection represent.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text says 'the Sultan knew Aladdin was perfect for his daughter,' showing approval, not jealousy. Reread how the Sultan reacts to seeing the palace.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

Think about what similar events occur in both locations.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct! The story structure shows this clear connection: In the cave section, Aladdin receives help from the ring genie who takes him out of the cave. In the palace section, Aladdin receives help from the lamp genie who creates the palace, fine clothes, servants, and the magnificent wedding. Both sections build on each other by showing Aladdin using magical assistance to overcome challenges, with each successive part escalating what the genies can provide - from simple escape to grand transformation.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

Only two genies appear (ring and lamp), not a new one in each section. The pattern involves what happens to Aladdin across sections. Look at how Aladdin's situation changes from section to section.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The author structures the story with a building pattern: Section 1 shows Aladdin gaining freedom from the cave; Section 2 shows him gaining food to survive; Section 3 shows him gaining the Sultan's attention and a marriage agreement; Section 4 shows him gaining a palace, wealth, and the actual wedding. Each successive part builds on earlier sections by showing Aladdin obtaining increasingly valuable things - from basic survival to ultimate success - creating a progressive structure where each section represents a step up in Aladdin's fortune.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story stays in the same region (the Sultan's kingdom and the cave nearby). Location doesn't change between sections.

The text shows this clear progression within the section: 'First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. Suddenly, a genie appeared.' The earlier action (calling and crying with no result) builds to the later action (praying) which accidentally activates the ring. This shows how the section develops from unsuccessful attempts to the successful escape, with each part building on what came before.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text clearly states the magician 'had gone back to North Africa' and never returns. Aladdin's yelling gets no response.

This detail demonstrates how the final section builds on the earlier challenge. In Section 3, the Sultan sets a condition: 'Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems.' Section 4 then builds on this by showing Aladdin meeting and exceeding the challenge: 'the genie brought forty servants. Each servant carried a large golden bowl' filled with gems.
