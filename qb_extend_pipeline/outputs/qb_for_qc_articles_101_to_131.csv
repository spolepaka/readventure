        Did you know that many explorers had older brothers? Very few of them were the oldest sons in their families. Can you guess why that might be?
It's not because firstborn children didn't want to go out and explore the world. It has to do with the laws in Europe at the time. Most countries in Europe had laws about who could inherit an estate. These laws said that the oldest son in a family would inherit all of his father's land, goods, and money.
This was true for kings. When a king died, he would be replaced on the throne by his eldest son. A daughter could only become queen if a king had no sons. This was also true for noble families. For example, if the Duke of Richland died, his eldest son would become the new Duke of Richland. This eldest son would inherit everything his father owned.

---

What did the younger sons and daughters get? Nothing. This system is known as primogeniture. Primo means ""first."" ""Geniture"" means born. Primogeniture is a system in which the firstborn son inherits everything when his father dies.
This way of doing things seems very strange to us today. It also seems unfair. Most parents today would not leave all their money and property to their oldest son. They would split the money and property up among all their children. Why, then, did Europeans do things differently back in the 1400s and 1500s?
There is actually a good reason. Let's go back to the Duke of Richland. Imagine that he is a wealthy landowner living in a land with no law of primogeniture. Let's say he owns 1,000 acres of good farmland. But, sadly, he dies. His land is split between his two sons. So now we have two men, each of whom has 500 acres of land.

---

Now, suppose each of these two men has four sons. When the fathers die, their lands are split again. So now we have eight men with 125 acres each. Do you see what is happening? The estate of Richland is being split up. It is no longer big and impressive. It is becoming small and unimportant. The men of Richland are probably also becoming less powerful because they each have less land.
Also, who is the Duke of Richland now? Are all eight of his grandsons now dukes? Will their grandsons also be dukes? At this rate, the land will be overrun by dukes! The noble families did not want this to happen. They wanted to keep their lands together, so their families would remain powerful. They wanted there to be one Duke of Richland and they wanted him to remain one of the most powerful men in the country. That is why they passed laws of primogeniture.

---

This was good news for the oldest son in each family. It was bad news for the other sons and for all the daughters. They had to find other ways to make money and gain power. One way to do this was to be an explorer. If you could not inherit anything in your homeland, why not sail off and discover some other way to make your fortune?
This is, in fact, what many second sons did in the late 1400s and 1500s. They went in search of ways to make money they would never have inherited if they stayed in Europe. Some hoped to find gold and silver to import back to their home countries. Others wanted to find new lands where they could write their names on a scroll as the discoverer.

        Did you know that many explorers had older brothers? Very few of them were the oldest sons in their families. Can you guess why that might be?
It's not because firstborn children didn't want to go out and explore the world. It has to do with the laws in Europe at the time. Most countries in Europe had laws about who could inherit an estate. These laws said that the oldest son in a family would inherit all of his father's land, goods, and money.
This was true for kings. When a king died, he would be replaced on the throne by his eldest son. A daughter could only become queen if a king had no sons. This was also true for noble families. For example, if the Duke of Richland died, his eldest son would become the new Duke of Richland. This eldest son would inherit everything his father owned.

---

What did the younger sons and daughters get? Nothing. This system is known as primogeniture. Primo means ""first."" ""Geniture"" means born. Primogeniture is a system in which the firstborn son inherits everything when his father dies.
This way of doing things seems very strange to us today. It also seems unfair. Most parents today would not leave all their money and property to their oldest son. They would split the money and property up among all their children. Why, then, did Europeans do things differently back in the 1400s and 1500s?
There is actually a good reason. Let's go back to the Duke of Richland. Imagine that he is a wealthy landowner living in a land with no law of primogeniture. Let's say he owns 1,000 acres of good farmland. But, sadly, he dies. His land is split between his two sons. So now we have two men, each of whom has 500 acres of land.

---

Now, suppose each of these two men has four sons. When the fathers die, their lands are split again. So now we have eight men with 125 acres each. Do you see what is happening? The estate of Richland is being split up. It is no longer big and impressive. It is becoming small and unimportant. The men of Richland are probably also becoming less powerful because they each have less land.
Also, who is the Duke of Richland now? Are all eight of his grandsons now dukes? Will their grandsons also be dukes? At this rate, the land will be overrun by dukes! The noble families did not want this to happen. They wanted to keep their lands together, so their families would remain powerful. They wanted there to be one Duke of Richland and they wanted him to remain one of the most powerful men in the country. That is why they passed laws of primogeniture.

---

This was good news for the oldest son in each family. It was bad news for the other sons and for all the daughters. They had to find other ways to make money and gain power. One way to do this was to be an explorer. If you could not inherit anything in your homeland, why not sail off and discover some other way to make your fortune?

        Did you know that many explorers had older brothers? Very few of them were the oldest sons in their families. Can you guess why that might be?
It's not because firstborn children didn't want to go out and explore the world. It has to do with the laws in Europe at the time. Most countries in Europe had laws about who could inherit an estate. These laws said that the oldest son in a family would inherit all of his father's land, goods, and money.
This was true for kings. When a king died, he would be replaced on the throne by his eldest son. A daughter could only become queen if a king had no sons. This was also true for noble families. For example, if the Duke of Richland died, his eldest son would become the new Duke of Richland. This eldest son would inherit everything his father owned.

---

What did the younger sons and daughters get? Nothing. This system is known as primogeniture. Primo means ""first."" ""Geniture"" means born. Primogeniture is a system in which the firstborn son inherits everything when his father dies.
This way of doing things seems very strange to us today. It also seems unfair. Most parents today would not leave all their money and property to their oldest son. They would split the money and property up among all their children. Why, then, did Europeans do things differently back in the 1400s and 1500s?
There is actually a good reason. Let's go back to the Duke of Richland. Imagine that he is a wealthy landowner living in a land with no law of primogeniture. Let's say he owns 1,000 acres of good farmland. But, sadly, he dies. His land is split between his two sons. So now we have two men, each of whom has 500 acres of land.

---

Now, suppose each of these two men has four sons. When the fathers die, their lands are split again. So now we have eight men with 125 acres each. Do you see what is happening? The estate of Richland is being split up. It is no longer big and impressive. It is becoming small and unimportant. The men of Richland are probably also becoming less powerful because they each have less land.
Also, who is the Duke of Richland now? Are all eight of his grandsons now dukes? Will their grandsons also be dukes? At this rate, the land will be overrun by dukes! The noble families did not want this to happen. They wanted to keep their lands together, so their families would remain powerful.

What did the younger sons and daughters get? Nothing. This system is known as primogeniture. Primo means ""first."" ""Geniture"" means born. Primogeniture is a system in which the firstborn son inherits everything when his father dies.
This way of doing things seems very strange to us today. It also seems unfair. Most parents today would not leave all their money and property to their oldest son. They would split the money and property up among all their children. Why, then, did Europeans do things differently back in the 1400s and 1500s?
There is actually a good reason. Let's go back to the Duke of Richland. Imagine that he is a wealthy landowner living in a land with no law of primogeniture. Let's say he owns 1,000 acres of good farmland. But, sadly, he dies. His land is split between his two sons. So now we have two men, each of whom has 500 acres of land.

---

Now, suppose each of these two men has four sons. When the fathers die, their lands are split again. So now we have eight men with 125 acres each. Do you see what is happening? The estate of Richland is being split up. It is no longer big and impressive. It is becoming small and unimportant. The men of Richland are probably also becoming less powerful because they each have less land.
Also, who is the Duke of Richland now? Are all eight of his grandsons now dukes? Will their grandsons also be dukes? At this rate, the land will be overrun by dukes! The noble families did not want this to happen. They wanted to keep their lands together, so their families would remain powerful. They wanted there to be one Duke of Richland and they wanted him to remain one of the most powerful men in the country. That is why they passed laws of primogeniture.

---

This was good news for the oldest son in each family. It was bad news for the other sons and for all the daughters. They had to find other ways to make money and gain power. One way to do this was to be an explorer. If you could not inherit anything in your homeland, why not sail off and discover some other way to make your fortune?
This is, in fact, what many second sons did in the late 1400s and 1500s. They went in search of ways to make money they would never have inherited if they stayed in Europe. Some hoped to find gold and silver to import back to their home countries. Others wanted to find new lands where they could write their names on a scroll as the discoverer.

        Did you know that many explorers had older brothers? Very few of them were the oldest sons in their families. Can you guess why that might be?
It's not because firstborn children didn't want to go out and explore the world. It has to do with the laws in Europe at the time. Most countries in Europe had laws about who could inherit an estate. These laws said that the oldest son in a family would inherit all of his father's land, goods, and money.

        An Italian man named Paolo Toscanelli may have been responsible for Europeans landing in the Americas. Toscanelli was a math whiz, an astronomer, and a mapmaker. In 1474, he made a map of the world. He sent this map with a letter to the King of Portugal. The letter told how to reach the Indies by sailing west. The King was very interested, but Toscanelli was not correct about where things really were.
On the right side of Toscanelli's map, you can see some parts of Europe in orange. You may know some of them: Ireland, London in England, and Lisbon in Portugal. To the south of Europe, you can see part of Africa. The Canary Islands are just off the coast of Africa.

Look at the left side of the map. This side shows parts of Asia, but it shows where Toscanelli thought they might be, not where they really are. Do you see the big island labeled Cippangu? That was what Toscanelli and other Europeans called Japan. They had heard about Japan and knew it was somewhere in Asia. But they did not know exactly where it was. Toscanelli put it on his map where he thought it might be.
Do you see the land labeled Cathay Mangi? That was what people called China back then. They had read about China in a book called The Travels of Marco Polo. But they did not know exactly where China was. The map shows where Toscanelli thought China was, not where it really is. Below China on the map are the ""spice islands"" that Europeans wanted to reach so badly.

Notice that Asia does not seem too far from Europe on this map. That was one of Toscanelli's big mistakes. He thought Earth was much smaller than it really is. He thought Asia was probably not too far from Europe, so that's how he drew it.
Now, imagine you are Christopher Columbus. You want to find a way to get to the Indies. You look at Toscanelli's map and think, ""Wow! Asia is right there! It's not so far from Europe.

Notice that Asia does not seem too far from Europe on this map. That was one of Toscanelli's big mistakes. He thought Earth was much smaller than it really is. He thought Asia was probably not too far from Europe, so that's how he drew it.

        An Italian man named Paolo Toscanelli may have been responsible for Europeans landing in the Americas. Toscanelli was a math whiz, an astronomer, and a mapmaker. In 1474, he made a map of the world. He sent this map with a letter to the King of Portugal. The letter told how to reach the Indies by sailing west. The King was very interested, but Toscanelli was not correct about where things really were.
On the right side of Toscanelli's map, you can see some parts of Europe in orange. You may know some of them: Ireland, London in England, and Lisbon in Portugal. To the south of Europe, you can see part of Africa. The Canary Islands are just off the coast of Africa.

Look at the left side of the map. This side shows parts of Asia, but it shows where Toscanelli thought they might be, not where they really are. Do you see the big island labeled Cippangu? That was what Toscanelli and other Europeans called Japan. They had heard about Japan and knew it was somewhere in Asia. But they did not know exactly where it was. Toscanelli put it on his map where he thought it might be.
Do you see the land labeled Cathay Mangi? That was what people called China back then. They had read about China in a book called The Travels of Marco Polo. But they did not know exactly where China was. The map shows where Toscanelli thought China was, not where it really is. Below China on the map are the ""spice islands"" that Europeans wanted to reach so badly.

Notice that Asia does not seem too far from Europe on this map. That was one of Toscanelli's big mistakes. He thought Earth was much smaller than it really is. He thought Asia was probably not too far from Europe, so that's how he drew it.
Now, imagine you are Christopher Columbus. You want to find a way to get to the Indies. You look at Toscanelli's map and think, ""Wow! Asia is right there! It's not so far from Europe. There's nothing in between but a little water! I could get there in just a few weeks by sailing west!"" Columbus made a plan to travel to the Indies based on this map.

        An Italian man named Paolo Toscanelli may have been responsible for Europeans landing in the Americas. Toscanelli was a math whiz, an astronomer, and a mapmaker. In 1474, he made a map of the world. He sent this map with a letter to the King of Portugal. The letter told how to reach the Indies by sailing west. The King was very interested, but Toscanelli was not correct about where things really were.
On the right side of Toscanelli's map, you can see some parts of Europe in orange. You may know some of them: Ireland, London in England, and Lisbon in Portugal. To the south of Europe, you can see part of Africa. The Canary Islands are just off the coast of Africa.

---

Look at the left side of the map. This side shows parts of Asia, but it shows where Toscanelli thought they might be, not where they really are. Do you see the big island labeled Cippangu? That was what Toscanelli and other Europeans called Japan. They had heard about Japan and knew it was somewhere in Asia. But they did not know exactly where it was. Toscanelli put it on his map where he thought it might be.
Do you see the land labeled Cathay Mangi? That was what people called China back then. They had read about China in a book called The Travels of Marco Polo. But they did not know exactly where China was. The map shows where Toscanelli thought China was, not where it really is. Below China on the map are the ""spice islands"" that Europeans wanted to reach so badly.

---

Notice that Asia does not seem too far from Europe on this map. That was one of Toscanelli's big mistakes. He thought Earth was much smaller than it really is. He thought Asia was probably not too far from Europe, so that's how he drew it.
Now, imagine you are Christopher Columbus. You want to find a way to get to the Indies. You look at Toscanelli's map and think, ""Wow! Asia is right there! It's not so far from Europe. There's nothing in between but a little water! I could get there in just a few weeks by sailing west!"" Columbus made a plan to travel to the Indies based on this map. Then he worked hard to convince someone to pay for his voyage. In the end, he got King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to pay for his trip.

Here's what really happened: The light blue on the map shows what is actually there, not what Toscanelli thought was there. You can see North America and part of South America. The orange parts show the Asian lands Columbus expected to reach. The light blue outline shows the lands where he actually landed by accident.

        Do you ever go on trips with your family? How do the adults in your family find the places they want to visit? Do they write down directions? Do they use maps? Do they look for landmarks along the way? Do they have an electronic device that tells them where to turn?
Early European explorers didn't have most of those things. Most sailors in those days stayed close to land and looked for familiar landmarks. However, this would not work for explorers. They could not look for familiar landmarks because they were sailing into unknown waters. Early explorers did have some maps, but they were not always accurate. So how did the explorers keep track of where they were?

---

They had several tools that they could use. One of them was a compass. A compass is a very simple device. It is just a little magnet that sits on a pin so it can spin. The pointer on the magnet points north. Back then, nobody knew why. Now, we know it's because Earth has a magnetic field, which is strongest at the poles. Magnets are attracted to the magnetic field of the North Pole. Using a compass, a sailor could figure out which direction was north. Plus, if he knew which direction was north, he could figure out south, east, and west. That was a big help.
Explorers also used the stars to keep track of their position. Sailors in this day used two gadgets. One was called a quadrant. The other one was called an astrolabe. The details of how these gadgets work are complicated, but the basic idea is not. The idea is that you can keep track of your position on Earth by keeping track of where certain stars appear to be in the night sky.

---

Others may have kept track of how far they had traveled using a method called dead reckoning. Here's how dead reckoning worked: a sailor had a piece of wood that was tied to a rope. The rope was knotted at regular spaces. There might be a knot every five feet. The sailor would toss the piece of wood overboard while the ship was sailing. When the wood hit the water, the sailor would turn over an hourglass.
The sailor or the captain of the ship would then watch to see how much rope was pulled out of the ship and into the sea. If the ship was going fast, it would quickly leave the piece of wood behind. It would pull many yards of rope out of the ship before the hourglass ran out. If the ship was going slower, it would not pull as much rope out.

---

Then, the person would count how many knots of rope got pulled out of the ship before the hourglass emptied out. If you have ever heard of a ship's speed referred to as knots, this is a forerunner of that measurement of speed. A ship's captain could use dead reckoning to make an estimate of how fast the ship was moving. Then, he could expect how far the ship would travel in an hour or a day. He could use a compass to know which way he was heading. He could put all this together to make an estimate of where he was.",,,,,The author of this passage would most likely agree that,MCQ,Early explorers were foolish to sail without GPS.,Navigation tools helped explorers find their way.,Dead reckoning was the only reliable method.,Modern families should use compasses instead of maps.,B,Good try! The passage never says explorers were foolish - it shows they were smart and used tools like compasses and stars. The story is about how navigation tools helped explorers find their way.,"Great job!

        Do you ever go on trips with your family? How do the adults in your family find the places they want to visit? Do they write down directions? Do they use maps? Do they look for landmarks along the way? Do they have an electronic device that tells them where to turn?
Early European explorers didn't have most of those things. Most sailors in those days stayed close to land and looked for familiar landmarks. However, this would not work for explorers. They could not look for familiar landmarks because they were sailing into unknown waters. Early explorers did have some maps, but they were not always accurate. So how did the explorers keep track of where they were?

---

They had several tools that they could use. One of them was a compass. A compass is a very simple device. It is just a little magnet that sits on a pin so it can spin. The pointer on the magnet points north. Back then, nobody knew why. Now, we know it's because Earth has a magnetic field, which is strongest at the poles. Magnets are attracted to the magnetic field of the North Pole. Using a compass, a sailor could figure out which direction was north. Plus, if he knew which direction was north, he could figure out south, east, and west. That was a big help.
Explorers also used the stars to keep track of their position. Sailors in this day used two gadgets. One was called a quadrant. The other one was called an astrolabe. The details of how these gadgets work are complicated, but the basic idea is not. The idea is that you can keep track of your position on Earth by keeping track of where certain stars appear to be in the night sky.

---

Others may have kept track of how far they had traveled using a method called dead reckoning. Here's how dead reckoning worked: a sailor had a piece of wood that was tied to a rope. The rope was knotted at regular spaces. There might be a knot every five feet. The sailor would toss the piece of wood overboard while the ship was sailing. When the wood hit the water, the sailor would turn over an hourglass.
The sailor or the captain of the ship would then watch to see how much rope was pulled out of the ship and into the sea. If the ship was going fast, it would quickly leave the piece of wood behind. It would pull many yards of rope out of the ship before the hourglass ran out. If the ship was going slower, it would not pull as much rope out.

---

Then, the person would count how many knots of rope got pulled out of the ship before the hourglass emptied out. If you have ever heard of a ship's speed referred to as knots, this is a forerunner of that measurement of speed. A ship's captain could use dead reckoning to make an estimate of how fast the ship was moving. Then, he could expect how far the ship would travel in an hour or a day. He could use a compass to know which way he was heading. He could put all this together to make an estimate of where he was.",,,,,What would the author think about a sailor who refuses to use any navigation tools?,MCQ,The sailor is wise because tools can give wrong information.,The sailor is brave to rely only on personal instincts.,The sailor would have difficulty knowing their position and direction.,The sailor is following the example of most early explorers.,C,"Good try!

Explorers also used the stars to keep track of their position. Sailors in this day used two gadgets. One was called a quadrant. The other one was called an astrolabe. The details of how these gadgets work are complicated, but the basic idea is not. The idea is that you can keep track of your position on Earth by keeping track of where certain stars appear to be in the night sky.

Others may have kept track of how far they had traveled using a method called dead reckoning. Here's how dead reckoning worked: a sailor had a piece of wood that was tied to a rope. The rope was knotted at regular spaces. There might be a knot every five feet. The sailor would toss the piece of wood overboard while the ship was sailing. When the wood hit the water, the sailor would turn over an hourglass.
The sailor or the captain of the ship would then watch to see how much rope was pulled out of the ship and into the sea. If the ship was going fast, it would quickly leave the piece of wood behind. It would pull many yards of rope out of the ship before the hourglass ran out. If the ship was going slower, it would not pull as much rope out.

---

Then, the person would count how many knots of rope got pulled out of the ship before the hourglass emptied out. If you have ever heard of a ship's speed referred to as knots, this is a forerunner of that measurement of speed. A ship's captain could use dead reckoning to make an estimate of how fast the ship was moving. Then, he could expect how far the ship would travel in an hour or a day.

        Do you ever go on trips with your family? How do the adults in your family find the places they want to visit? Do they write down directions? Do they use maps? Do they look for landmarks along the way? Do they have an electronic device that tells them where to turn?
Early European explorers didn't have most of those things. Most sailors in those days stayed close to land and looked for familiar landmarks. However, this would not work for explorers. They could not look for familiar landmarks because they were sailing into unknown waters. Early explorers did have some maps, but they were not always accurate. So how did the explorers keep track of where they were?

---

They had several tools that they could use. One of them was a compass. A compass is a very simple device. It is just a little magnet that sits on a pin so it can spin. The pointer on the magnet points north. Back then, nobody knew why. Now, we know it's because Earth has a magnetic field, which is strongest at the poles. Magnets are attracted to the magnetic field of the North Pole. Using a compass, a sailor could figure out which direction was north. Plus, if he knew which direction was north, he could figure out south, east, and west. That was a big help.
Explorers also used the stars to keep track of their position. Sailors in this day used two gadgets. One was called a quadrant. The other one was called an astrolabe. The details of how these gadgets work are complicated, but the basic idea is not. The idea is that you can keep track of your position on Earth by keeping track of where certain stars appear to be in the night sky.

---

Others may have kept track of how far they had traveled using a method called dead reckoning. Here's how dead reckoning worked: a sailor had a piece of wood that was tied to a rope. The rope was knotted at regular spaces. There might be a knot every five feet. The sailor would toss the piece of wood overboard while the ship was sailing. When the wood hit the water, the sailor would turn over an hourglass.
The sailor or the captain of the ship would then watch to see how much rope was pulled out of the ship and into the sea. If the ship was going fast, it would quickly leave the piece of wood behind. It would pull many yards of rope out of the ship before the hourglass ran out. If the ship was going slower, it would not pull as much rope out.

---

Then, the person would count how many knots of rope got pulled out of the ship before the hourglass emptied out. If you have ever heard of a ship's speed referred to as knots, this is a forerunner of that measurement of speed. A ship's captain could use dead reckoning to make an estimate of how fast the ship was moving. Then, he could expect how far the ship would travel in an hour or a day. He could use a compass to know which way he was heading. He could put all this together to make an estimate of where he was.",,,,,Why does the author include the detailed explanation of how dead reckoning worked in paragraphs 5 and 6?,MCQ,to show that this method was too complicated for most sailors to learn,to demonstrate that dead reckoning was the most important navigation tool,to help readers understand how explorers calculated speed and distance without modern tools,to prove that the term 'knots' for ship speed has no connection to actual knots,C,Good try!

        The building you see is a fort in St. Augustine, Florida. The Spanish came ashore and built a settlement there in 1565. They established the oldest town in the United States that people have lived in without stopping. This means people have lived there continuously for over 450 years! You can visit this amazing place today and see the old buildings that are still standing.
This fort is called El Castillo de San Marcos. That is its Spanish name, which means the Castle of Saint Mark in English. The Spanish did not build this fort first. They built seven or eight other forts before this one. But those earlier forts were made of wood and were not very strong. Some were damaged when enemies tried to destroy them in wars. Others were knocked down and became a wreck when hurricanes hit them with powerful winds.

---

In 1672, the Spanish decided to build a new fort using stone to make it much stronger. The inside of the fort is shaped like a square. On each corner, there is a special part called a bastion. A bastion is shaped like an arrow and sticks out from the fort. It is a raised platform where soldiers could stand with their guns and cannons. The bastions let the Spanish fire their weapons in almost any direction to protect the fort.
Imagine you are a soldier trying to attack this bastion. It would be very dangerous! If you tried to get close, Spanish soldiers on top would shoot at you with guns and cannons. If you brought a ladder to climb up, the men in the fort would push it over. They might even drop hot oil on you. You could try attacking with cannons, but the thick stone walls would not shatter or break easily. The Spanish had their own cannons too, and they would fire back at you!

---

The walls of El Castillo de San Marcos are made of something very special - seashells! The Spanish used a type of rock called coquina. Coquina is made of fossils and seashells mixed together. These shells are what remains of tiny sea animals that lived long, long ago. Scientists estimate that these creatures lived millions of years in the past. The Spanish found coquina rocks along the Florida seashore and used them to build their fort.
Coquina turned out to be perfect for building forts. It is softer than other rocks, so it does not crack when cannonballs hit it. Instead, a cannonball might make a dent in the wall or get stuck in it, but the wall would stay strong and not break apart.

---

The fort was surrounded by a deep ditch called a moat. Today the moat is dry, but long ago it was filled with water. There was only one way to enter the fort safely. First, you had to go through a small fort called the ravelin that stood in front of the main fort. Then you crossed a bridge over the moat. The last part of this bridge was special - it was a drawbridge that could be lifted up to keep enemies out.
It was hard work to open the drawbridge. It took five strong men fifteen minutes to lift it! El Castillo de San Marcos has been occupied by soldiers for hundreds of years. Even though it was attacked many times by different enemies, this strong fortress was never captured. Today, visitors can explore this amazing piece of history that has stood strong for over 350 years.",,,,,Someone might read this passage to,MCQ,learn facts about a historic fort,persuade others to visit Florida,enjoy a story about soldiers,learn how to build a fort,A,"Great job!

        The building you see is a fort in St. Augustine, Florida. The Spanish came ashore and built a settlement there in 1565. They established the oldest town in the United States that people have lived in without stopping. This means people have lived there continuously for over 450 years! You can visit this amazing place today and see the old buildings that are still standing.
This fort is called El Castillo de San Marcos. That is its Spanish name, which means the Castle of Saint Mark in English. The Spanish did not build this fort first. They built seven or eight other forts before this one. But those earlier forts were made of wood and were not very strong. Some were damaged when enemies tried to destroy them in wars. Others were knocked down and became a wreck when hurricanes hit them with powerful winds.

---

In 1672, the Spanish decided to build a new fort using stone to make it much stronger. The inside of the fort is shaped like a square. On each corner, there is a special part called a bastion. A bastion is shaped like an arrow and sticks out from the fort. It is a raised platform where soldiers could stand with their guns and cannons. The bastions let the Spanish fire their weapons in almost any direction to protect the fort.
Imagine you are a soldier trying to attack this bastion. It would be very dangerous! If you tried to get close, Spanish soldiers on top would shoot at you with guns and cannons. If you brought a ladder to climb up, the men in the fort would push it over. They might even drop hot oil on you. You could try attacking with cannons, but the thick stone walls would not shatter or break easily. The Spanish had their own cannons too, and they would fire back at you!

The walls of El Castillo de San Marcos are made of something very special - seashells! The Spanish used a type of rock called coquina. Coquina is made of fossils and seashells mixed together. These shells are what remains of tiny sea animals that lived long, long ago. Scientists estimate that these creatures lived millions of years in the past. The Spanish found coquina rocks along the Florida seashore and used them to build their fort.

        The building you see is a fort in St. Augustine, Florida. The Spanish came ashore and built a settlement there in 1565. They established the oldest town in the United States that people have lived in without stopping. This means people have lived there continuously for over 450 years! You can visit this amazing place today and see the old buildings that are still standing.
This fort is called El Castillo de San Marcos. That is its Spanish name, which means the Castle of Saint Mark in English. The Spanish did not build this fort first. They built seven or eight other forts before this one. But those earlier forts were made of wood and were not very strong. Some were damaged when enemies tried to destroy them in wars. Others were knocked down and became a wreck when hurricanes hit them with powerful winds.

---

In 1672, the Spanish decided to build a new fort using stone to make it much stronger. The inside of the fort is shaped like a square. On each corner, there is a special part called a bastion. A bastion is shaped like an arrow and sticks out from the fort. It is a raised platform where soldiers could stand with their guns and cannons. The bastions let the Spanish fire their weapons in almost any direction to protect the fort.
Imagine you are a soldier trying to attack this bastion. It would be very dangerous! If you tried to get close, Spanish soldiers on top would shoot at you with guns and cannons. If you brought a ladder to climb up, the men in the fort would push it over. They might even drop hot oil on you. You could try attacking with cannons, but the thick stone walls would not shatter or break easily. The Spanish had their own cannons too, and they would fire back at you!

---

The walls of El Castillo de San Marcos are made of something very special - seashells! The Spanish used a type of rock called coquina. Coquina is made of fossils and seashells mixed together. These shells are what remains of tiny sea animals that lived long, long ago. Scientists estimate that these creatures lived millions of years in the past. The Spanish found coquina rocks along the Florida seashore and used them to build their fort.
Coquina turned out to be perfect for building forts. It is softer than other rocks, so it does not crack when cannonballs hit it. Instead, a cannonball might make a dent in the wall or get stuck in it, but the wall would stay strong and not break apart.

---

The fort was surrounded by a deep ditch called a moat. Today the moat is dry, but long ago it was filled with water. There was only one way to enter the fort safely. First, you had to go through a small fort called the ravelin that stood in front of the main fort. Then you crossed a bridge over the moat. The last part of this bridge was special - it was a drawbridge that could be lifted up to keep enemies out.
It was hard work to open the drawbridge. It took five strong men fifteen minutes to lift it! El Castillo de San Marcos has been occupied by soldiers for hundreds of years. Even though it was attacked many times by different enemies, this strong fortress was never captured.

        Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was a Spanish explorer who came to America long ago. He wanted to find seven special cities that people said had streets made of gold. During his trip, Coronado wrote letters to the King of Spain. In one letter from 1541, he told the king about his long journey across the Great Plains to a place called Quivira in what is now Kansas. He wrote about the native people he met and the buffalo he saw along the way.
Coronado began his letter by telling the king about meeting native people from a distant land. These people would boast about their homeland called Quivira. They said the men there lived in big houses and their chiefs ate from dishes made of gold. Coronado did not know if he should believe these stories, but he decided to go see Quivira for himself.

---

The Spanish explorers set off in the spring and reached the vast plains. These grasslands were so huge that they could not see where they ended. The land was flat and open with tall grasses that moved in the wind. They traveled over 300 leagues, which is a very long distance. The plains were full of buffalo, which Coronado called ""cows"" in his letter. There were so many buffalo that they could not count them all.
After 17 days, they met native people called the Querechos. These people did not grow crops like farmers. Instead, they followed the buffalo herds and lived by hunting them. They would eat the meat and tan the buffalo skins to make clothes and small tents. Dogs helped them carry their tents and poles as they moved from place to place. The journey was hard because the plain had few landmarks to help them find their way.

---

After 77 days of traveling, Coronado finally reached Quivira. But he was very disappointed. Instead of the tall stone houses like a fortress with a moat and ravelin that the guides had described, he found only small grass huts. The people there were few in number, and Coronado thought they were barbarous because their way of life was so different from his own. Still, they agreed to obey the Spanish king and accept his royal lordship.
The native people gave Coronado a piece of copper, which he sent back to the viceroy of New Spain. This was the only metal he found in the area, along with some small copper bells. There was no gold anywhere, which was what he had really hoped to find.

---

Coronado stayed in Quivira for 25 days and explored the nearby lands. Even though he did not find gold, he noticed that the soil was rich and black, perfect for growing crops. The land had plenty of water from springs and rivers. He found fruits that reminded him of home, including prunes like those in Spain, nuts, sweet grapes, and mulberry trees. In his letter, Coronado told the king that he had treated all the native people well and had not harmed anyone during his journey.

        Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was a Spanish explorer who came to America long ago. He wanted to find seven special cities that people said had streets made of gold. During his trip, Coronado wrote letters to the King of Spain. In one letter from 1541, he told the king about his long journey across the Great Plains to a place called Quivira in what is now Kansas. He wrote about the native people he met and the buffalo he saw along the way.
Coronado began his letter by telling the king about meeting native people from a distant land. These people would boast about their homeland called Quivira. They said the men there lived in big houses and their chiefs ate from dishes made of gold. Coronado did not know if he should believe these stories, but he decided to go see Quivira for himself.

---

The Spanish explorers set off in the spring and reached the vast plains. These grasslands were so huge that they could not see where they ended. The land was flat and open with tall grasses that moved in the wind. They traveled over 300 leagues, which is a very long distance. The plains were full of buffalo, which Coronado called ""cows"" in his letter. There were so many buffalo that they could not count them all.
After 17 days, they met native people called the Querechos. These people did not grow crops like farmers. Instead, they followed the buffalo herds and lived by hunting them. They would eat the meat and tan the buffalo skins to make clothes and small tents. Dogs helped them carry their tents and poles as they moved from place to place. The journey was hard because the plain had few landmarks to help them find their way.

---

After 77 days of traveling, Coronado finally reached Quivira. But he was very disappointed. Instead of the tall stone houses like a fortress with a moat and ravelin that the guides had described, he found only small grass huts. The people there were few in number, and Coronado thought they were barbarous because their way of life was so different from his own. Still, they agreed to obey the Spanish king and accept his royal lordship.
The native people gave Coronado a piece of copper, which he sent back to the viceroy of New Spain. This was the only metal he found in the area, along with some small copper bells. There was no gold anywhere, which was what he had really hoped to find.

---

Coronado stayed in Quivira for 25 days and explored the nearby lands. Even though he did not find gold, he noticed that the soil was rich and black, perfect for growing crops. The land had plenty of water from springs and rivers. He found fruits that reminded him of home, including prunes like those in Spain, nuts, sweet grapes, and mulberry trees. In his letter, Coronado told the king that he had treated all the native people well and had not harmed anyone during his journey.

The Spanish explorers set off in the spring and reached the vast plains. These grasslands were so huge that they could not see where they ended. The land was flat and open with tall grasses that moved in the wind. They traveled over 300 leagues, which is a very long distance. The plains were full of buffalo, which Coronado called ""cows"" in his letter. There were so many buffalo that they could not count them all.
After 17 days, they met native people called the Querechos. These people did not grow crops like farmers. Instead, they followed the buffalo herds and lived by hunting them. They would eat the meat and tan the buffalo skins to make clothes and small tents. Dogs helped them carry their tents and poles as they moved from place to place. The journey was hard because the plain had few landmarks to help them find their way.

After 77 days of traveling, Coronado finally reached Quivira. But he was very disappointed. Instead of the tall stone houses like a fortress with a moat and ravelin that the guides had described, he found only small grass huts.

Still, they agreed to obey the Spanish king and accept his royal lordship.
The native people gave Coronado a piece of copper, which he sent back to the viceroy of New Spain. This was the only metal he found in the area, along with some small copper bells. There was no gold anywhere, which was what he had really hoped to find.

        John Cabot was an explorer from Italy who had the same dream as Columbus. He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.
Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

---

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

---

Cabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.

---

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump. This pump removed water that leaked into the ship. It was a terrible job because the water smelled awful and made sailors sick.
The food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard. Sailors had to soak it in water to make it soft enough to eat. The good thing about hardtack was that it would not spoil on long trips. But if it got wet, bugs called weevils could get into it.

        John Cabot was an explorer from Italy who had the same dream as Columbus. He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.
Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

---

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

---

Cabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump.

        John Cabot was an explorer from Italy who had the same dream as Columbus. He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.
Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

---

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

---

Cabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump. This pump removed water that leaked into the ship. It was a terrible job because the water smelled awful and made sailors sick.
The food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard.

        John Cabot was an explorer from Italy who had the same dream as Columbus. He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.
Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

---

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

---

Cabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump. This pump removed water that leaked into the ship. It was a terrible job because the water smelled awful and made sailors sick.
The food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard. Sailors had to soak it in water to make it soft enough to eat. The good thing about hardtack was that it would not spoil on long trips. But if it got wet, bugs called weevils could get into it.

        An Englishman named Henry Hudson tried four times to find the Northwest Passage. He died trying. First, in 1607, he tried sailing north from England. If you look at a globe, you can see what he was trying to do. He knew that Earth was round and he thought he could sail across the North Pole. He didn't know that solid ice always covers the Arctic Ocean.
""I hoped to have a clear sea,"" Hudson wrote about his first trip, ""but that was not possible because of the ice around us."" Hudson tried again in 1608. He sailed northeast and again found icebergs and freezing cold weather. He turned his boat around and tried sailing northwest. When his crew saw that they weren't going home, they decided to rebel against Hudson. They said they wouldn't work unless they sailed back to England. So, home they went.

---

In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed west. This time, he was working for a group of businessmen called the Dutch East India Company. On this trip, he reached North America and claimed land for Holland. Hudson saw many native people. One man who sailed with him wrote in his journal, ""They are dressed well in loose deer skins and brought green tobacco which they gave us in exchange for knives and beads."" The native people also gave the sailors bread made of maize.
Hudson sailed past ""a very good piece of ground and a cliff close by of white-green color...on the side of the river called Manna-hata."" It was the island we now call Manhattan, which is the center of New York City today. Next, Hudson sailed up a river that still has his name. You can find the Hudson River on a map of New York state.

After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall into bed and rest their tired bodies. They were ready, but there were no beds for them. The captain had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept on the deck. As the ship moved back and forth with the waves, the sailors moved with it. Most sailors had to stand watch for part of the night. When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.

In 1610, Hudson tried once more to find a shortcut from Europe to Asia. He sailed a ship called Discovery into a wide area of water in the northern part of Canada. Today, it is named after him: the Hudson Bay. On the map, Hudson Bay looks like a big, open body of water. But in many places, the water gets too shallow for sailing. In many other places, it is frozen almost all year long.
Once again, Henry Hudson had sailed into icy waters just as winter was coming. Hudson and his crew went on land during the winter. They ran out of food and water. Some of the crew got sick. Some died. The sailors blamed Hudson for caring more about finding the Northwest Passage than about keeping his crew safe and healthy. When the ice began to melt, the crew rebelled again.

        An Englishman named Henry Hudson tried four times to find the Northwest Passage. He died trying. First, in 1607, he tried sailing north from England. If you look at a globe, you can see what he was trying to do. He knew that Earth was round and he thought he could sail across the North Pole. He didn't know that solid ice always covers the Arctic Ocean.
""I hoped to have a clear sea,"" Hudson wrote about his first trip, ""but that was not possible because of the ice around us."" Hudson tried again in 1608. He sailed northeast and again found icebergs and freezing cold weather. He turned his boat around and tried sailing northwest. When his crew saw that they weren't going home, they decided to rebel against Hudson. They said they wouldn't work unless they sailed back to England. So, home they went.

---

In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed west. This time, he was working for a group of businessmen called the Dutch East India Company. On this trip, he reached North America and claimed land for Holland. Hudson saw many native people. One man who sailed with him wrote in his journal, ""They are dressed well in loose deer skins and brought green tobacco which they gave us in exchange for knives and beads."" The native people also gave the sailors bread made of maize.
Hudson sailed past ""a very good piece of ground and a cliff close by of white-green color...on the side of the river called Manna-hata."" It was the island we now call Manhattan, which is the center of New York City today. Next, Hudson sailed up a river that still has his name. You can find the Hudson River on a map of New York state.

After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall into bed and rest their tired bodies. They were ready, but there were no beds for them. The captain had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept on the deck. As the ship moved back and forth with the waves, the sailors moved with it. Most sailors had to stand watch for part of the night. When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.

In 1610, Hudson tried once more to find a shortcut from Europe to Asia. He sailed a ship called Discovery into a wide area of water in the northern part of Canada. Today, it is named after him: the Hudson Bay. On the map, Hudson Bay looks like a big, open body of water. But in many places, the water gets too shallow for sailing. In many other places, it is frozen almost all year long.
Once again, Henry Hudson had sailed into icy waters just as winter was coming. Hudson and his crew went on land during the winter. They ran out of food and water. Some of the crew got sick.

After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall into bed and rest their tired bodies. They were ready, but there were no beds for them. The captain had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept on the deck. As the ship moved back and forth with the waves, the sailors moved with it. Most sailors had to stand watch for part of the night. When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.

In 1610, Hudson tried once more to find a shortcut from Europe to Asia. He sailed a ship called Discovery into a wide area of water in the northern part of Canada. Today, it is named after him: the Hudson Bay. On the map, Hudson Bay looks like a big, open body of water. But in many places, the water gets too shallow for sailing. In many other places, it is frozen almost all year long.
Once again, Henry Hudson had sailed into icy waters just as winter was coming. Hudson and his crew went on land during the winter. They ran out of food and water. Some of the crew got sick. Some died. The sailors blamed Hudson for caring more about finding the Northwest Passage than about keeping his crew safe and healthy. When the ice began to melt, the crew rebelled again.

        An Englishman named Henry Hudson tried four times to find the Northwest Passage. He died trying. First, in 1607, he tried sailing north from England. If you look at a globe, you can see what he was trying to do. He knew that Earth was round and he thought he could sail across the North Pole. He didn't know that solid ice always covers the Arctic Ocean.
""I hoped to have a clear sea,"" Hudson wrote about his first trip, ""but that was not possible because of the ice around us."" Hudson tried again in 1608. He sailed northeast and again found icebergs and freezing cold weather. He turned his boat around and tried sailing northwest. When his crew saw that they weren't going home, they decided to rebel against Hudson. They said they wouldn't work unless they sailed back to England. So, home they went.

In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed west. This time, he was working for a group of businessmen called the Dutch East India Company. On this trip, he reached North America and claimed land for Holland. Hudson saw many native people.

After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall into bed and rest their tired bodies. They were ready, but there were no beds for them. The captain had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept on the deck. As the ship moved back and forth with the waves, the sailors moved with it. Most sailors had to stand watch for part of the night. When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.

In 1610, Hudson tried once more to find a shortcut from Europe to Asia. He sailed a ship called Discovery into a wide area of water in the northern part of Canada.

In many other places, it is frozen almost all year long.

        An Englishman named Henry Hudson tried four times to find the Northwest Passage. He died trying. First, in 1607, he tried sailing north from England. If you look at a globe, you can see what he was trying to do. He knew that Earth was round and he thought he could sail across the North Pole. He didn't know that solid ice always covers the Arctic Ocean.
""I hoped to have a clear sea,"" Hudson wrote about his first trip, ""but that was not possible because of the ice around us."" Hudson tried again in 1608. He sailed northeast and again found icebergs and freezing cold weather. He turned his boat around and tried sailing northwest. When his crew saw that they weren't going home, they decided to rebel against Hudson. They said they wouldn't work unless they sailed back to England. So, home they went.

In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed west. This time, he was working for a group of businessmen called the Dutch East India Company. On this trip, he reached North America and claimed land for Holland.

        An Englishman named Henry Hudson tried four times to find the Northwest Passage. He died trying. First, in 1607, he tried sailing north from England. If you look at a globe, you can see what he was trying to do. He knew that Earth was round and he thought he could sail across the North Pole. He didn't know that solid ice always covers the Arctic Ocean.
""I hoped to have a clear sea,"" Hudson wrote about his first trip, ""but that was not possible because of the ice around us."" Hudson tried again in 1608. He sailed northeast and again found icebergs and freezing cold weather. He turned his boat around and tried sailing northwest. When his crew saw that they weren't going home, they decided to rebel against Hudson. They said they wouldn't work unless they sailed back to England. So, home they went.

---

In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed west. This time, he was working for a group of businessmen called the Dutch East India Company. On this trip, he reached North America and claimed land for Holland. Hudson saw many native people. One man who sailed with him wrote in his journal, ""They are dressed well in loose deer skins and brought green tobacco which they gave us in exchange for knives and beads."" The native people also gave the sailors bread made of maize.
Hudson sailed past ""a very good piece of ground and a cliff close by of white-green color...on the side of the river called Manna-hata."" It was the island we now call Manhattan, which is the center of New York City today. Next, Hudson sailed up a river that still has his name. You can find the Hudson River on a map of New York state.

After a long day of work, sailors were ready to fall into bed and rest their tired bodies. They were ready, but there were no beds for them. The captain had a bed to sleep in, but the sailors did not. They slept on the deck. As the ship moved back and forth with the waves, the sailors moved with it. Most sailors had to stand watch for part of the night. When that was done, they could sleep for a few hours. In the morning, they would get up and do it all over again.

In 1610, Hudson tried once more to find a shortcut from Europe to Asia. He sailed a ship called Discovery into a wide area of water in the northern part of Canada. Today, it is named after him: the Hudson Bay. On the map, Hudson Bay looks like a big, open body of water. But in many places, the water gets too shallow for sailing. In many other places, it is frozen almost all year long.
Once again, Henry Hudson had sailed into icy waters just as winter was coming. Hudson and his crew went on land during the winter. They ran out of food and water. Some of the crew got sick. Some died. The sailors blamed Hudson for caring more about finding the Northwest Passage than about keeping his crew safe and healthy. When the ice began to melt, the crew rebelled again.

        Many French people came to North America in the 1600s and 1700s to trade for animal furs. These traders worked with Native American people. They would barter by giving European goods to get animal skins and furs in return.
The traders collected many kinds of fur, but they wanted beaver pelts the most. Beaver hats were very popular in Europe. People would buy beaver hats in England, France, Germany, and Russia. Beaver fur is thick and waterproof, so it kept heads warm and dry. Some hat makers used beaver fur to make soft, puffy hats. Others made the fur into felt, which was smooth and waterproof.
In many parts of Europe, hunters had killed too many beavers. The beavers had almost gone extinct. Europeans could not get beaver pelts at home, so they were willing to pay for pelts from North America.

---

Samuel de Champlain and other French explorers led the fur trade. They built trading posts in North America along the Atlantic Coast, in Quebec, along the St. Lawrence River, and near the Great Lakes.
In July 1609, Champlain traveled down a river to a large lake that would later be named Lake Champlain. He wrote about his journey. The lake had many pretty islands with fine forests and lush meadows. There were countless birds and wild animals like deer, bears, and fawns. Many rivers emptied into the lake, and it had great numbers of fish. Champlain saw chestnut trees he had never seen before. Mountains in the distance had snow on top, and he learned that the Iroquois people lived in the beautiful valleys there.

The French made treaties with different Native American groups, including the Algonquin and Huron people. These agreements meant they would trade peacefully together. Native people would bring beaver pelts they had gathered themselves or had gotten by trading with other tribes.
Native people wanted to obtain things made of metal because most tribes did not make their own metal products. They would trade furs for knives, ax blades, kettles, and fish hooks. They also wanted glass beads from Europe, wool blankets, tobacco, guns, and gunpowder.
The French would collect lots of beaver pelts and ship them back to France to sell. They made a lot of money this way. The fur trade covered a huge expanse of North America and continued for two hundred years. It was so important to Canada's history that in 2011, Canada put a beaver on the back of their nickel coin.",,,,,"According to Section 3, which action happens immediately before the French sell the beaver pelts in Europe?",MCQ,Ship the pelts across the Atlantic to French ports.,Trade with Native peoples for furs in North America.,Negotiate treaties with Native groups to maintain peaceful trade.,Trap and collect beaver pelts in North America.,A,"Great job!

        Many French people came to North America in the 1600s and 1700s to trade for animal furs. These traders worked with Native American people. They would barter by giving European goods to get animal skins and furs in return.
The traders collected many kinds of fur, but they wanted beaver pelts the most. Beaver hats were very popular in Europe. People would buy beaver hats in England, France, Germany, and Russia. Beaver fur is thick and waterproof, so it kept heads warm and dry. Some hat makers used beaver fur to make soft, puffy hats. Others made the fur into felt, which was smooth and waterproof.
In many parts of Europe, hunters had killed too many beavers. The beavers had almost gone extinct. Europeans could not get beaver pelts at home, so they were willing to pay for pelts from North America.

Samuel de Champlain and other French explorers led the fur trade. They built trading posts in North America along the Atlantic Coast, in Quebec, along the St. Lawrence River, and near the Great Lakes.
In July 1609, Champlain traveled down a river to a large lake that would later be named Lake Champlain. He wrote about his journey. The lake had many pretty islands with fine forests and lush meadows. There were countless birds and wild animals like deer, bears, and fawns. Many rivers emptied into the lake, and it had great numbers of fish. Champlain saw chestnut trees he had never seen before. Mountains in the distance had snow on top, and he learned that the Iroquois people lived in the beautiful valleys there.

The French made treaties with different Native American groups, including the Algonquin and Huron people. These agreements meant they would trade peacefully together. Native people would bring beaver pelts they had gathered themselves or had gotten by trading with other tribes.
Native people wanted to obtain things made of metal because most tribes did not make their own metal products. They would trade furs for knives, ax blades, kettles, and fish hooks. They also wanted glass beads from Europe, wool blankets, tobacco, guns, and gunpowder.
The French would collect lots of beaver pelts and ship them back to France to sell. They made a lot of money this way.

In many parts of Europe, hunters had killed too many beavers. The beavers had almost gone extinct. Europeans could not get beaver pelts at home, so they were willing to pay for pelts from North America.

Samuel de Champlain and other French explorers led the fur trade. They built trading posts in North America along the Atlantic Coast, in Quebec, along the St. Lawrence River, and near the Great Lakes.
In July 1609, Champlain traveled down a river to a large lake that would later be named Lake Champlain. He wrote about his journey. The lake had many pretty islands with fine forests and lush meadows. There were countless birds and wild animals like deer, bears, and fawns. Many rivers emptied into the lake, and it had great numbers of fish. Champlain saw chestnut trees he had never seen before. Mountains in the distance had snow on top, and he learned that the Iroquois people lived in the beautiful valleys there.

The French made treaties with different Native American groups, including the Algonquin and Huron people. These agreements meant they would trade peacefully together. Native people would bring beaver pelts they had gathered themselves or had gotten by trading with other tribes.
Native people wanted to obtain things made of metal because most tribes did not make their own metal products. They would trade furs for knives, ax blades, kettles, and fish hooks. They also wanted glass beads from Europe, wool blankets, tobacco, guns, and gunpowder.

        Many people think that Columbus was the first person to arrive in America. But that is not correct. There are at least two other groups of people who came to North America many years before Christopher Columbus ever sailed across the ocean.
One group was the Vikings. The Vikings lived in Northern Europe, in a place called Scandinavia. They sailed around the world in their strong ships. Sometimes they would raid other places, taking things that did not belong to them. In the year 982, some Vikings left Iceland and made their homes in Greenland. Greenland is part of North America. They arrived there about 500 years before Columbus made his famous trip.

---

The Viking settlements in Greenland grew bigger over time. Scientists who study old things think there were probably 3,000 to 5,000 Viking settlers living there at one time. The Vikings had farms and made their income by raising animals and trading with other people. But after many years, the Vikings decided to leave Greenland. They had to abandon their settlements in the 1400s, not long before Columbus made his voyage.
The Vikings also explored other lands west of Greenland. Around the year 1000, a famous Viking explorer named Leif Eriksson visited a land that he and other Vikings called Vinland. Most experts believe Vinland was somewhere along the coast of Newfoundland, which is in modern-day Canada. There is strong evidence that some Vikings made settlements in Newfoundland. In 1960, scientists found the ruins of an old Viking village there. This village may have been part of Vinland.

---

The Vikings definitely reached America before Columbus did. So maybe we should say the Vikings were the first Europeans to settle in North America. But before we decide this, we need to learn about another group that came to North America.
Another group that settled in North America was the Native Americans. Even though we call these people ""Native"" Americans, they did not always live in the Americas. They came to America from Asia many thousands of years ago. When and how this happened is something that scientists still talk about and study.

Some historians think the first settlers made their way to North America a little more than 15,000 years ago. Other scientists think the first people came to America much earlier than that. They think it might have been 40,000 years ago. Some experts believe these people walked across land when Alaska and Asia were connected. Others think they may have traveled along the coast in boats.
Experts think the first humans lived in Africa. About 100,000 years ago, some humans moved out of Africa and into the Middle East. About 70,000 years ago, a group of humans moved into southeast Asia. About 15,000 years ago, some of these people crossed from Asia to the Americas. Scientists believe that many people also came to North America by traveling in ships along different routes.

They came to America from Asia many thousands of years ago. When and how this happened is something that scientists still talk about and study.

        Many people think that Columbus was the first person to arrive in America. But that is not correct. There are at least two other groups of people who came to North America many years before Christopher Columbus ever sailed across the ocean.
One group was the Vikings. The Vikings lived in Northern Europe, in a place called Scandinavia. They sailed around the world in their strong ships. Sometimes they would raid other places, taking things that did not belong to them. In the year 982, some Vikings left Iceland and made their homes in Greenland. Greenland is part of North America. They arrived there about 500 years before Columbus made his famous trip.

---

The Viking settlements in Greenland grew bigger over time. Scientists who study old things think there were probably 3,000 to 5,000 Viking settlers living there at one time. The Vikings had farms and made their income by raising animals and trading with other people. But after many years, the Vikings decided to leave Greenland. They had to abandon their settlements in the 1400s, not long before Columbus made his voyage.
The Vikings also explored other lands west of Greenland. Around the year 1000, a famous Viking explorer named Leif Eriksson visited a land that he and other Vikings called Vinland. Most experts believe Vinland was somewhere along the coast of Newfoundland, which is in modern-day Canada. There is strong evidence that some Vikings made settlements in Newfoundland. In 1960, scientists found the ruins of an old Viking village there. This village may have been part of Vinland.

        Many people think that Columbus was the first person to arrive in America. But that is not correct. There are at least two other groups of people who came to North America many years before Christopher Columbus ever sailed across the ocean.
One group was the Vikings. The Vikings lived in Northern Europe, in a place called Scandinavia. They sailed around the world in their strong ships. Sometimes they would raid other places, taking things that did not belong to them. In the year 982, some Vikings left Iceland and made their homes in Greenland. Greenland is part of North America. They arrived there about 500 years before Columbus made his famous trip.

---

The Viking settlements in Greenland grew bigger over time. Scientists who study old things think there were probably 3,000 to 5,000 Viking settlers living there at one time. The Vikings had farms and made their income by raising animals and trading with other people. But after many years, the Vikings decided to leave Greenland. They had to abandon their settlements in the 1400s, not long before Columbus made his voyage.
The Vikings also explored other lands west of Greenland. Around the year 1000, a famous Viking explorer named Leif Eriksson visited a land that he and other Vikings called Vinland. Most experts believe Vinland was somewhere along the coast of Newfoundland, which is in modern-day Canada. There is strong evidence that some Vikings made settlements in Newfoundland. In 1960, scientists found the ruins of an old Viking village there. This village may have been part of Vinland.

The Vikings definitely reached America before Columbus did. So maybe we should say the Vikings were the first Europeans to settle in North America. But before we decide this, we need to learn about another group that came to North America.
Another group that settled in North America was the Native Americans. Even though we call these people ""Native"" Americans, they did not always live in the Americas. They came to America from Asia many thousands of years ago. When and how this happened is something that scientists still talk about and study.

Some historians think the first settlers made their way to North America a little more than 15,000 years ago. Other scientists think the first people came to America much earlier than that. They think it might have been 40,000 years ago. Some experts believe these people walked across land when Alaska and Asia were connected. Others think they may have traveled along the coast in boats.

        Many people think that Columbus was the first person to arrive in America. But that is not correct. There are at least two other groups of people who came to North America many years before Christopher Columbus ever sailed across the ocean.
One group was the Vikings. The Vikings lived in Northern Europe, in a place called Scandinavia. They sailed around the world in their strong ships. Sometimes they would raid other places, taking things that did not belong to them. In the year 982, some Vikings left Iceland and made their homes in Greenland. Greenland is part of North America. They arrived there about 500 years before Columbus made his famous trip.

---

The Viking settlements in Greenland grew bigger over time. Scientists who study old things think there were probably 3,000 to 5,000 Viking settlers living there at one time. The Vikings had farms and made their income by raising animals and trading with other people. But after many years, the Vikings decided to leave Greenland. They had to abandon their settlements in the 1400s, not long before Columbus made his voyage.
The Vikings also explored other lands west of Greenland. Around the year 1000, a famous Viking explorer named Leif Eriksson visited a land that he and other Vikings called Vinland. Most experts believe Vinland was somewhere along the coast of Newfoundland, which is in modern-day Canada. There is strong evidence that some Vikings made settlements in Newfoundland. In 1960, scientists found the ruins of an old Viking village there. This village may have been part of Vinland.

---

The Vikings definitely reached America before Columbus did. So maybe we should say the Vikings were the first Europeans to settle in North America. But before we decide this, we need to learn about another group that came to North America.
Another group that settled in North America was the Native Americans. Even though we call these people ""Native"" Americans, they did not always live in the Americas. They came to America from Asia many thousands of years ago. When and how this happened is something that scientists still talk about and study.

---

Some historians think the first settlers made their way to North America a little more than 15,000 years ago. Other scientists think the first people came to America much earlier than that. They think it might have been 40,000 years ago. Some experts believe these people walked across land when Alaska and Asia were connected. Others think they may have traveled along the coast in boats.
Experts think the first humans lived in Africa. About 100,000 years ago, some humans moved out of Africa and into the Middle East. About 70,000 years ago, a group of humans moved into southeast Asia. About 15,000 years ago, some of these people crossed from Asia to the Americas. Scientists believe that many people also came to North America by traveling in ships along different routes.

        Did you know that some words we use every day come from the Caribbean? The Caribbean is an area with many islands between North and South America. These words were first used by native people who lived there long before Columbus came. Later, Europeans who came to the New World started using these words too, including people who spoke English.
Let's learn about four words that came from the Caribbean. Each word has clues to help you guess what it is.

---

The first word describes a big storm with strong winds that spin around in a circle. This storm is like a tornado but much bigger. It usually travels over water and gets weaker when it goes over land. People on the east coast have to worry about these storms because the winds can knock down houses. This word rhymes with ""window pane."" The answer is hurricane! The word hurricane comes from the Carib language. People in the Caribbean know all about hurricanes because several big storms sweep through their islands every year.
The second word is a type of small boat that holds two or three people. The people in the boat face forward and use paddles to make it move. The person in front pulls back with a paddle. The person in back uses a paddle to steer the boat in the right direction. You should not stand up in this boat because it might tip over. This word rhymes with ""bamboo."" The answer is canoe! Caribbean people used canoes to paddle from island to island. They cut down trees and used tools and fire to dig out canoes from the tree trunks.

---

The third word names both a kind of food and a way of cooking. When people cook outside over a smoky fire, they use this type of cooking. Some people like to cook pork, beef, or chicken this way. Another way to say this word is BBQ. The answer is barbecue! Caribbean people cooked food over open fires and called it barbricot. This is where our word barbecue came from.
The fourth word is a vegetable that people in Europe had never seen before Spanish explorers came to the New World. Some people like to eat this vegetable baked with butter or sour cream. Others slice it thin and cook it in hot oil to make crunchy chips. People also cut it into long pieces and fry it to make french fries. The answer is potato!

---

The potato is a New World crop that grew in Peru, South America, and other places in the Americas. People in Peru called it papa. Caribbean people called it batata. The Spanish called it patata. We call it potato. The Spanish brought potatoes back to Europe, where people discovered they were cheap to grow and grew well in many countries. By the late 1700s, lots of European farmers were growing potatoes. French fries were probably invented in France. Thomas Jefferson wrote about fried potatoes around 1805 after learning about them from a French cook.

        Did you know that some words we use every day come from the Caribbean? The Caribbean is an area with many islands between North and South America. These words were first used by native people who lived there long before Columbus came. Later, Europeans who came to the New World started using these words too, including people who spoke English.
Let's learn about four words that came from the Caribbean. Each word has clues to help you guess what it is.

The first word describes a big storm with strong winds that spin around in a circle. This storm is like a tornado but much bigger. It usually travels over water and gets weaker when it goes over land. People on the east coast have to worry about these storms because the winds can knock down houses. This word rhymes with ""window pane."" The answer is hurricane! The word hurricane comes from the Carib language. People in the Caribbean know all about hurricanes because several big storms sweep through their islands every year.
The second word is a type of small boat that holds two or three people. The people in the boat face forward and use paddles to make it move. The person in front pulls back with a paddle. The person in back uses a paddle to steer the boat in the right direction. You should not stand up in this boat because it might tip over. This word rhymes with ""bamboo."" The answer is canoe! Caribbean people used canoes to paddle from island to island. They cut down trees and used tools and fire to dig out canoes from the tree trunks.

---

The third word names both a kind of food and a way of cooking. When people cook outside over a smoky fire, they use this type of cooking. Some people like to cook pork, beef, or chicken this way. Another way to say this word is BBQ. The answer is barbecue! Caribbean people cooked food over open fires and called it barbricot. This is where our word barbecue came from.
The fourth word is a vegetable that people in Europe had never seen before Spanish explorers came to the New World. Some people like to eat this vegetable baked with butter or sour cream. Others slice it thin and cook it in hot oil to make crunchy chips. People also cut it into long pieces and fry it to make french fries. The answer is potato!

The potato is a New World crop that grew in Peru, South America, and other places in the Americas. People in Peru called it papa. Caribbean people called it batata. The Spanish called it patata. We call it potato. The Spanish brought potatoes back to Europe, where people discovered they were cheap to grow and grew well in many countries. By the late 1700s, lots of European farmers were growing potatoes. French fries were probably invented in France.

        Robert and George ran along the sandy beach on Roanoke Island. They splashed in the warm water and picked up pretty shells. It was August 1587, and they hoped to be the first successful English settlers in North America. The boys watched their leader, John White, sail away to England. He was going to get supplies they needed to live on the island. But this story really started many years before.
In the 1500s, Spain took over large parts of Central and South America. Spanish ships called galleons sailed across the ocean carrying gold and treasures back to Spain. Spain was getting very rich from these treasures. Queen Elizabeth I of England and her knight, Sir Walter Raleigh, wanted England to become rich and powerful too. They wanted English people to go to the New World. In 1584, Sir Walter was able to persuade Queen Elizabeth to let him try to start an English colony in America. The English decided to stay away from the strong Spanish soldiers. Instead of going to Central or South America, they would sail north to North America.

The first group of explorers went to North America in 1584. They told Sir Walter that Roanoke Island would be perfect for the first English colony. These explorers built a fort on the island, but they could not create a lasting settlement. They left only fifteen men behind to guard the fort. Sir Walter did not give up. In 1587, he sent more ships to the New World. Robert and George were part of this second group of would-be colonists. They were excited about this great adventure.
The colonists planned to land north of Roanoke Island, in the Chesapeake Bay area. But during the trip, John White had a fight with the ship's crew. The crew refused to take the English travelers to Chesapeake Bay. So Robert, George, and the other passengers had to land on Roanoke Island instead. The boys did not mind this change. They were just happy to be on land again.

After landing, John White led a group of men to Fort Raleigh. Robert and George could not go with them. At the fort, the men expected to find the fifteen English soldiers who had been left to guard it. But when they got there, the soldiers were gone. The fort was overgrown with weeds and plants. They found the skeleton of one dead soldier.
When John White returned with this alarming news, Robert and George felt scared. The adults thought the Roanoke Native Americans might have killed the soldiers. The good news was that they could fix the homes in Fort Raleigh. More than one hundred men, women, and children worked hard to rebuild these homes. But everyone worried about the most serious problem: they did not have enough food to last through winter. They had arrived too late to plant crops.

So Robert and George watched John White's ship sail away. The boys played on the beach and enjoyed their freedom in this new land. They did not miss the crowded streets of Portsmouth, England.

        Robert and George ran along the sandy beach on Roanoke Island. They splashed in the warm water and picked up pretty shells. It was August 1587, and they hoped to be the first successful English settlers in North America. The boys watched their leader, John White, sail away to England. He was going to get supplies they needed to live on the island. But this story really started many years before.
In the 1500s, Spain took over large parts of Central and South America. Spanish ships called galleons sailed across the ocean carrying gold and treasures back to Spain. Spain was getting very rich from these treasures. Queen Elizabeth I of England and her knight, Sir Walter Raleigh, wanted England to become rich and powerful too. They wanted English people to go to the New World. In 1584, Sir Walter was able to persuade Queen Elizabeth to let him try to start an English colony in America. The English decided to stay away from the strong Spanish soldiers. Instead of going to Central or South America, they would sail north to North America.

---

The first group of explorers went to North America in 1584. They told Sir Walter that Roanoke Island would be perfect for the first English colony. These explorers built a fort on the island, but they could not create a lasting settlement. They left only fifteen men behind to guard the fort. Sir Walter did not give up. In 1587, he sent more ships to the New World. Robert and George were part of this second group of would-be colonists. They were excited about this great adventure.
The colonists planned to land north of Roanoke Island, in the Chesapeake Bay area. But during the trip, John White had a fight with the ship's crew. The crew refused to take the English travelers to Chesapeake Bay. So Robert, George, and the other passengers had to land on Roanoke Island instead. The boys did not mind this change. They were just happy to be on land again.

---

After landing, John White led a group of men to Fort Raleigh. Robert and George could not go with them. At the fort, the men expected to find the fifteen English soldiers who had been left to guard it. But when they got there, the soldiers were gone. The fort was overgrown with weeds and plants. They found the skeleton of one dead soldier.
When John White returned with this alarming news, Robert and George felt scared. The adults thought the Roanoke Native Americans might have killed the soldiers. The good news was that they could fix the homes in Fort Raleigh. More than one hundred men, women, and children worked hard to rebuild these homes. But everyone worried about the most serious problem: they did not have enough food to last through winter. They had arrived too late to plant crops.

So Robert and George watched John White's ship sail away. The boys played on the beach and enjoyed their freedom in this new land. They did not miss the crowded streets of Portsmouth, England.

        Robert and George ran along the sandy beach on Roanoke Island. They splashed in the warm water and picked up pretty shells. It was August 1587, and they hoped to be the first successful English settlers in North America. The boys watched their leader, John White, sail away to England. He was going to get supplies they needed to live on the island. But this story really started many years before.
In the 1500s, Spain took over large parts of Central and South America. Spanish ships called galleons sailed across the ocean carrying gold and treasures back to Spain. Spain was getting very rich from these treasures. Queen Elizabeth I of England and her knight, Sir Walter Raleigh, wanted England to become rich and powerful too. They wanted English people to go to the New World. In 1584, Sir Walter was able to persuade Queen Elizabeth to let him try to start an English colony in America. The English decided to stay away from the strong Spanish soldiers. Instead of going to Central or South America, they would sail north to North America.

---

The first group of explorers went to North America in 1584. They told Sir Walter that Roanoke Island would be perfect for the first English colony. These explorers built a fort on the island, but they could not create a lasting settlement. They left only fifteen men behind to guard the fort. Sir Walter did not give up. In 1587, he sent more ships to the New World. Robert and George were part of this second group of would-be colonists. They were excited about this great adventure.
The colonists planned to land north of Roanoke Island, in the Chesapeake Bay area. But during the trip, John White had a fight with the ship's crew. The crew refused to take the English travelers to Chesapeake Bay. So Robert, George, and the other passengers had to land on Roanoke Island instead. The boys did not mind this change. They were just happy to be on land again.

---

After landing, John White led a group of men to Fort Raleigh. Robert and George could not go with them. At the fort, the men expected to find the fifteen English soldiers who had been left to guard it. But when they got there, the soldiers were gone. The fort was overgrown with weeds and plants. They found the skeleton of one dead soldier.
When John White returned with this alarming news, Robert and George felt scared. The adults thought the Roanoke Native Americans might have killed the soldiers. The good news was that they could fix the homes in Fort Raleigh. More than one hundred men, women, and children worked hard to rebuild these homes. But everyone worried about the most serious problem: they did not have enough food to last through winter. They had arrived too late to plant crops.

---

So Robert and George watched John White's ship sail away. The boys played on the beach and enjoyed their freedom in this new land. They did not miss the crowded streets of Portsmouth, England. They did not miss the rain or the poor people who would beg for money on the streets. This island was their new home, and they were happy to be there. The big question was: would they survive the winter? Would Roanoke Island become the first successful English colony in North America?",,,,,Why does the author include information about Spain and Queen Elizabeth in the passage?,MCQ,to explain why English colonists decided to come to North America,to compare the Spanish and English methods of building forts,to describe the types of ships used for ocean voyages,to show which country had more powerful military forces,A,"Great job!

        Tom Tucker was eating breakfast when his mother called to him. ""Tom, hurry up and eat your food. You should have been working in the tobacco fields an hour ago,"" said Mrs. Ann Tucker. Tom quickly finished his milk and bread. He had to gulp down his food because he was so late.
""I was helping Jane collect eggs from the chickens,"" Tom explained. Mrs. Tucker was the mistress of the house, which meant she was in charge of everything.

Tom and his sister Jane had come from London, England to Jamestown, Virginia in April 1618. They were street children who had lived on the streets after their parents died. When they first arrived in Jamestown, their clothes were tattered and grimy from their long, difficult journey across the ocean. Jane cried every day because she missed England.
King James I of England had sent one hundred children like Tom and Jane to Jamestown. There were too many homeless children in London, and the king thought they would cause trouble. He decided to send them 3,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean to help the colonists in America. The harshest part was leaving everything they knew behind, but the children had to work hard to survive in their new home.

The English colonists had first come to Jamestown in 1607. Life was very difficult at first. Many colonists died from hunger, sickness, and cold weather. The Powhatan people, who lived in Virginia before the English arrived, sometimes attacked the colonists. However, the colonists kept working to build their new community.
John Smith helped save the colony from failing completely. Another colonist named John Rolfe brought a new type of tobacco to Virginia. This tobacco crop became very important because people in Europe loved to smoke it. The colonists could sell tobacco and make lots of money. By 1618, they were sending over two thousand pounds of tobacco to England every year.

Growing tobacco required careful work all year long. First, the colonists planted tiny tobacco seeds in special beds and covered them with branches to protect them from snow. When the seeds grew into small plants called seedlings, the colonists had to transplant them into the fields. This meant carefully moving each small plant to a new spot where it could grow bigger.

Tom and his sister Jane had come from London, England to Jamestown, Virginia in April 1618. They were street children who had lived on the streets after their parents died. When they first arrived in Jamestown, their clothes were tattered and grimy from their long, difficult journey across the ocean. Jane cried every day because she missed England.
King James I of England had sent one hundred children like Tom and Jane to Jamestown. There were too many homeless children in London, and the king thought they would cause trouble. He decided to send them 3,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean to help the colonists in America. The harshest part was leaving everything they knew behind, but the children had to work hard to survive in their new home.

The English colonists had first come to Jamestown in 1607. Life was very difficult at first. Many colonists died from hunger, sickness, and cold weather. The Powhatan people, who lived in Virginia before the English arrived, sometimes attacked the colonists. However, the colonists kept working to build their new community.
John Smith helped save the colony from failing completely. Another colonist named John Rolfe brought a new type of tobacco to Virginia. This tobacco crop became very important because people in Europe loved to smoke it. The colonists could sell tobacco and make lots of money. By 1618, they were sending over two thousand pounds of tobacco to England every year.

Growing tobacco required careful work all year long. First, the colonists planted tiny tobacco seeds in special beds and covered them with branches to protect them from snow. When the seeds grew into small plants called seedlings, the colonists had to transplant them into the fields. This meant carefully moving each small plant to a new spot where it could grow bigger.

Tom and his sister Jane had come from London, England to Jamestown, Virginia in April 1618. They were street children who had lived on the streets after their parents died. When they first arrived in Jamestown, their clothes were tattered and grimy from their long, difficult journey across the ocean. Jane cried every day because she missed England.
King James I of England had sent one hundred children like Tom and Jane to Jamestown. There were too many homeless children in London, and the king thought they would cause trouble.

The English colonists had first come to Jamestown in 1607. Life was very difficult at first. Many colonists died from hunger, sickness, and cold weather. The Powhatan people, who lived in Virginia before the English arrived, sometimes attacked the colonists. However, the colonists kept working to build their new community.
John Smith helped save the colony from failing completely. Another colonist named John Rolfe brought a new type of tobacco to Virginia. This tobacco crop became very important because people in Europe loved to smoke it. The colonists could sell tobacco and make lots of money. By 1618, they were sending over two thousand pounds of tobacco to England every year.

Growing tobacco required careful work all year long. First, the colonists planted tiny tobacco seeds in special beds and covered them with branches to protect them from snow. When the seeds grew into small plants called seedlings, the colonists had to transplant them into the fields. This meant carefully moving each small plant to a new spot where it could grow bigger.

        Do you remember Tom and his sister Jane from the last chapter? Tom was an orphan boy living in Jamestown. Today you will learn more about Tom's life in this English colony.
Tom was very happy it was Sunday. This was the only day when most people did not work in the fields or shops. On Sunday, Tom could go hunting or fishing. Before chapel, Tom and his friend William would go catch rabbits or fish for dinner. Today was just like other Sundays, and William came to Tom's house very early in the morning.
Tom and William had been hunting and fishing together since Tom first came to Jamestown. Like Tom, William was also an orphan living in the colony. William had taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow and how to catch fish. Even though Tom had lived in a city before, he learned to hunt and fish very quickly. Mrs. Tucker said he took to it ""like a duck to water.""

---

William had learned his hunting skills from Powhatan boys. These boys had become friends with some of the English children. The Powhatan boys did not visit Jamestown very much anymore. The Powhatan people were no longer good friends with the colonists. The colonists were taking more and more land from the Powhatan to grow tobacco. The Powhatan wanted the colonists to leave their land, but the colonists were not going away. More and more colonists kept coming instead.
William respected the Powhatan and their knowledge of the land. He often talked to Tom about this. ""They get everything they need from the forest and the land,"" William would say. ""The men are expert hunters. They can catch more fish in one day than we catch in a whole week. The women grow corn, beans, and squash. They make their homes out of small trees, reeds, and bark. They use fur and hide from animals to make clothes. They know which berries and nuts are safe to eat and what plants make good medicine. Without their help, we never would have survived here.""

---

On this beautiful day, William was in a very good mood. ""Come on, Tom. Let's go catch our dinner,"" he called from the Tuckers' doorway. ""Don't be out there all day,"" said Mrs. Tucker. ""We won't be,"" Tom replied. Then the two boys ran toward the woods.
The boys loved being in the forest. At this time of year, everything looked, smelled, and sounded almost magical. As they walked quietly, they trod on a soft carpet of pine needles. Sunlight broke through the tall treetops, and bright shafts of light would illuminate their path. All around them, they could hear forest animals scurry through the leaves and branches.
They walked for a while, enjoying their freedom. They crossed a stream and bent down to drink water from their cupped hands. Suddenly, they heard a sharp sound of a branch breaking. The branch fell to the ground just a few feet away from them.

---

Both boys looked up right away. High up in a tree, about twenty feet above them, sat a Powhatan boy about their same age. He was sitting on a wide branch and looking down at them. His bow and arrow were pointed right at Tom.
William began speaking in a language Tom did not understand. The Powhatan boy answered back in the same language. Then the Powhatan boy smiled and climbed down the tree, landing right beside them. He motioned for them to follow him. William pushed Tom forward.
""What are we doing?"" whispered Tom. ""We're hunting,"" William replied. ""Are we hunting with him?"" Tom asked. ""Yes,"" William said. ""He's my friend. He's going to teach us how to hunt for deer."" ""I thought we were hunting for rabbits,"" said Tom nervously. ""Well, now we are hunting for deer,"" said William, smiling.

Tom was very happy it was Sunday. This was the only day when most people did not work in the fields or shops. On Sunday, Tom could go hunting or fishing. Before chapel, Tom and his friend William would go catch rabbits or fish for dinner. Today was just like other Sundays, and William came to Tom's house very early in the morning.
Tom and William had been hunting and fishing together since Tom first came to Jamestown. Like Tom, William was also an orphan living in the colony. William had taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow and how to catch fish. Even though Tom had lived in a city before, he learned to hunt and fish very quickly. Mrs. Tucker said he took to it ""like a duck to water.""

---

William had learned his hunting skills from Powhatan boys. These boys had become friends with some of the English children. The Powhatan boys did not visit Jamestown very much anymore. The Powhatan people were no longer good friends with the colonists. The colonists were taking more and more land from the Powhatan to grow tobacco. The Powhatan wanted the colonists to leave their land, but the colonists were not going away. More and more colonists kept coming instead.
William respected the Powhatan and their knowledge of the land. He often talked to Tom about this. ""They get everything they need from the forest and the land,"" William would say. ""The men are expert hunters. They can catch more fish in one day than we catch in a whole week. The women grow corn, beans, and squash. They make their homes out of small trees, reeds, and bark. They use fur and hide from animals to make clothes. They know which berries and nuts are safe to eat and what plants make good medicine. Without their help, we never would have survived here.""

---

On this beautiful day, William was in a very good mood. ""Come on, Tom. Let's go catch our dinner,"" he called from the Tuckers' doorway. ""Don't be out there all day,"" said Mrs. Tucker. ""We won't be,"" Tom replied. Then the two boys ran toward the woods.
The boys loved being in the forest. At this time of year, everything looked, smelled, and sounded almost magical. As they walked quietly, they trod on a soft carpet of pine needles. Sunlight broke through the tall treetops, and bright shafts of light would illuminate their path. All around them, they could hear forest animals scurry through the leaves and branches.
They walked for a while, enjoying their freedom. They crossed a stream and bent down to drink water from their cupped hands. Suddenly, they heard a sharp sound of a branch breaking. The branch fell to the ground just a few feet away from them.

---

Both boys looked up right away. High up in a tree, about twenty feet above them, sat a Powhatan boy about their same age. He was sitting on a wide branch and looking down at them. His bow and arrow were pointed right at Tom.
William began speaking in a language Tom did not understand. The Powhatan boy answered back in the same language. Then the Powhatan boy smiled and climbed down the tree, landing right beside them. He motioned for them to follow him. William pushed Tom forward.
""What are we doing?"" whispered Tom. ""We're hunting,"" William replied. ""Are we hunting with him?"" Tom asked. ""Yes,"" William said. ""He's my friend. He's going to teach us how to hunt for deer."" ""I thought we were hunting for rabbits,"" said Tom nervously. ""Well, now we are hunting for deer,"" said William, smiling. ""Come on, you survived the streets of London, didn't you?"" With that, William and Tom followed the Powhatan boy deeper into the forest.

Tom was very happy it was Sunday. This was the only day when most people did not work in the fields or shops. On Sunday, Tom could go hunting or fishing. Before chapel, Tom and his friend William would go catch rabbits or fish for dinner. Today was just like other Sundays, and William came to Tom's house very early in the morning.
Tom and William had been hunting and fishing together since Tom first came to Jamestown. Like Tom, William was also an orphan living in the colony. William had taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow and how to catch fish. Even though Tom had lived in a city before, he learned to hunt and fish very quickly. Mrs. Tucker said he took to it ""like a duck to water.""

---

William had learned his hunting skills from Powhatan boys. These boys had become friends with some of the English children. The Powhatan boys did not visit Jamestown very much anymore. The Powhatan people were no longer good friends with the colonists. The colonists were taking more and more land from the Powhatan to grow tobacco. The Powhatan wanted the colonists to leave their land, but the colonists were not going away. More and more colonists kept coming instead.
William respected the Powhatan and their knowledge of the land. He often talked to Tom about this. ""They get everything they need from the forest and the land,"" William would say. ""The men are expert hunters. They can catch more fish in one day than we catch in a whole week. The women grow corn, beans, and squash. They make their homes out of small trees, reeds, and bark. They use fur and hide from animals to make clothes. They know which berries and nuts are safe to eat and what plants make good medicine. Without their help, we never would have survived here.""

---

On this beautiful day, William was in a very good mood. ""Come on, Tom. Let's go catch our dinner,"" he called from the Tuckers' doorway. ""Don't be out there all day,"" said Mrs. Tucker. ""We won't be,"" Tom replied. Then the two boys ran toward the woods.
The boys loved being in the forest. At this time of year, everything looked, smelled, and sounded almost magical. As they walked quietly, they trod on a soft carpet of pine needles. Sunlight broke through the tall treetops, and bright shafts of light would illuminate their path. All around them, they could hear forest animals scurry through the leaves and branches.
They walked for a while, enjoying their freedom. They crossed a stream and bent down to drink water from their cupped hands. Suddenly, they heard a sharp sound of a branch breaking. The branch fell to the ground just a few feet away from them.

---

Both boys looked up right away. High up in a tree, about twenty feet above them, sat a Powhatan boy about their same age. He was sitting on a wide branch and looking down at them. His bow and arrow were pointed right at Tom.
William began speaking in a language Tom did not understand. The Powhatan boy answered back in the same language. Then the Powhatan boy smiled and climbed down the tree, landing right beside them. He motioned for them to follow him. William pushed Tom forward.
""What are we doing?"" whispered Tom. ""We're hunting,"" William replied. ""Are we hunting with him?"" Tom asked. ""Yes,"" William said. ""He's my friend. He's going to teach us how to hunt for deer."" ""I thought we were hunting for rabbits,"" said Tom nervously. ""Well, now we are hunting for deer,"" said William, smiling. ""Come on, you survived the streets of London, didn't you?"" With that, William and Tom followed the Powhatan boy deeper into the forest. Tom was nervous but excited to pluck up his courage for this new adventure.",,,,,How does the author use the information about tobacco farming to help convey the story's central message?,MCQ,It explains why the Powhatan people developed such advanced farming techniques,It shows the conflict that makes cultural friendship more difficult but still valuable,It demonstrates that colonists should have learned to grow tobacco from Powhatan farmers,It proves that economic success was more important than maintaining good relationships,B,Good try! The story doesn't talk about how Powhatan people farmed. Tobacco farming was done by the English colonists on Powhatan land.,"Exactly! The story shows that ""colonists were taking more and more land"" for tobacco, which hurt their friendship.

        Do you remember Tom and his sister Jane from the last chapter? Tom was an orphan boy living in Jamestown. Today you will learn more about Tom's life in this English colony.
Tom was very happy it was Sunday. This was the only day when most people did not work in the fields or shops. On Sunday, Tom could go hunting or fishing. Before chapel, Tom and his friend William would go catch rabbits or fish for dinner. Today was just like other Sundays, and William came to Tom's house very early in the morning.
Tom and William had been hunting and fishing together since Tom first came to Jamestown. Like Tom, William was also an orphan living in the colony. William had taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow and how to catch fish. Even though Tom had lived in a city before, he learned to hunt and fish very quickly. Mrs. Tucker said he took to it ""like a duck to water.""

---

William had learned his hunting skills from Powhatan boys. These boys had become friends with some of the English children. The Powhatan boys did not visit Jamestown very much anymore. The Powhatan people were no longer good friends with the colonists. The colonists were taking more and more land from the Powhatan to grow tobacco. The Powhatan wanted the colonists to leave their land, but the colonists were not going away. More and more colonists kept coming instead.
William respected the Powhatan and their knowledge of the land. He often talked to Tom about this. ""They get everything they need from the forest and the land,"" William would say. ""The men are expert hunters. They can catch more fish in one day than we catch in a whole week. The women grow corn, beans, and squash. They make their homes out of small trees, reeds, and bark. They use fur and hide from animals to make clothes. They know which berries and nuts are safe to eat and what plants make good medicine. Without their help, we never would have survived here.""

---

On this beautiful day, William was in a very good mood. ""Come on, Tom. Let's go catch our dinner,"" he called from the Tuckers' doorway. ""Don't be out there all day,"" said Mrs. Tucker. ""We won't be,"" Tom replied. Then the two boys ran toward the woods.
The boys loved being in the forest. At this time of year, everything looked, smelled, and sounded almost magical. As they walked quietly, they trod on a soft carpet of pine needles. Sunlight broke through the tall treetops, and bright shafts of light would illuminate their path. All around them, they could hear forest animals scurry through the leaves and branches.
They walked for a while, enjoying their freedom. They crossed a stream and bent down to drink water from their cupped hands. Suddenly, they heard a sharp sound of a branch breaking. The branch fell to the ground just a few feet away from them.

---

Both boys looked up right away. High up in a tree, about twenty feet above them, sat a Powhatan boy about their same age. He was sitting on a wide branch and looking down at them. His bow and arrow were pointed right at Tom.
William began speaking in a language Tom did not understand. The Powhatan boy answered back in the same language. Then the Powhatan boy smiled and climbed down the tree, landing right beside them. He motioned for them to follow him. William pushed Tom forward.
""What are we doing?"" whispered Tom. ""We're hunting,"" William replied. ""Are we hunting with him?"" Tom asked. ""Yes,"" William said. ""He's my friend. He's going to teach us how to hunt for deer."" ""I thought we were hunting for rabbits,"" said Tom nervously. ""Well, now we are hunting for deer,"" said William, smiling. ""Come on, you survived the streets of London, didn't you?"" With that, William and Tom followed the Powhatan boy deeper into the forest.

        Do you remember Tom and his sister Jane from the last chapter? Tom was an orphan boy living in Jamestown. Today you will learn more about Tom's life in this English colony.
Tom was very happy it was Sunday. This was the only day when most people did not work in the fields or shops. On Sunday, Tom could go hunting or fishing. Before chapel, Tom and his friend William would go catch rabbits or fish for dinner. Today was just like other Sundays, and William came to Tom's house very early in the morning.
Tom and William had been hunting and fishing together since Tom first came to Jamestown. Like Tom, William was also an orphan living in the colony. William had taught Tom how to use a bow and arrow and how to catch fish. Even though Tom had lived in a city before, he learned to hunt and fish very quickly. Mrs. Tucker said he took to it ""like a duck to water.""

---

William had learned his hunting skills from Powhatan boys. These boys had become friends with some of the English children. The Powhatan boys did not visit Jamestown very much anymore. The Powhatan people were no longer good friends with the colonists. The colonists were taking more and more land from the Powhatan to grow tobacco. The Powhatan wanted the colonists to leave their land, but the colonists were not going away. More and more colonists kept coming instead.
William respected the Powhatan and their knowledge of the land. He often talked to Tom about this. ""They get everything they need from the forest and the land,"" William would say. ""The men are expert hunters. They can catch more fish in one day than we catch in a whole week. The women grow corn, beans, and squash. They make their homes out of small trees, reeds, and bark. They use fur and hide from animals to make clothes. They know which berries and nuts are safe to eat and what plants make good medicine. Without their help, we never would have survived here.""

---

On this beautiful day, William was in a very good mood. ""Come on, Tom. Let's go catch our dinner,"" he called from the Tuckers' doorway. ""Don't be out there all day,"" said Mrs. Tucker. ""We won't be,"" Tom replied. Then the two boys ran toward the woods.
The boys loved being in the forest. At this time of year, everything looked, smelled, and sounded almost magical. As they walked quietly, they trod on a soft carpet of pine needles. Sunlight broke through the tall treetops, and bright shafts of light would illuminate their path. All around them, they could hear forest animals scurry through the leaves and branches.
They walked for a while, enjoying their freedom. They crossed a stream and bent down to drink water from their cupped hands. Suddenly, they heard a sharp sound of a branch breaking. The branch fell to the ground just a few feet away from them.

---

Both boys looked up right away. High up in a tree, about twenty feet above them, sat a Powhatan boy about their same age. He was sitting on a wide branch and looking down at them. His bow and arrow were pointed right at Tom.
William began speaking in a language Tom did not understand. The Powhatan boy answered back in the same language. Then the Powhatan boy smiled and climbed down the tree, landing right beside them. He motioned for them to follow him. William pushed Tom forward.
""What are we doing?"" whispered Tom. ""We're hunting,"" William replied. ""Are we hunting with him?"" Tom asked. ""Yes,"" William said. ""He's my friend. He's going to teach us how to hunt for deer."" ""I thought we were hunting for rabbits,"" said Tom nervously. ""Well, now we are hunting for deer,"" said William, smiling.

        Seth was playing hide-and-seek with his friends Laura, Helen, and Joseph. ""Seth, it's your turn to hide,"" they called out. Laura was the oldest child. She said, ""We'll count to thirty-three and then add five more seconds.""
""Okay. Turn around now. Don't peek,"" said Seth. The three children turned their backs while Seth ran to find a good hiding spot. None of the children had hidden in the wagon yet. Seth ran to the wagon near the barn and crawled under a giant piece of sack cloth. Soon the three children yelled, ""Ready or not, here we come!""
Seth lay very still in the wagon that was used to transport sacks of rice to town. He could hear his friends running everywhere, searching for him. This was so much fun! Slave children did not get much time to play games.

---

The children looked in the barn, in the cook's kitchen, and in the chicken coop. They did not think to look in the wagon. After searching for a long time, they gave up. ""Seth, we can't find you. You can come out now,"" they called. But Seth did not answer. He was so warm and comfortable under the sack cloth that he had fallen asleep.
When Seth did not come out, the three children ran off to do their work. They knew that if Seth did not appear soon, he would get into a whole heap of trouble. All four children were slaves who lived on a large plantation in South Carolina in 1715. It was called the Walker Plantation. The main crop they grew was rice, and many African slaves knew how to grow rice from their homeland.
Life on the plantation was very hard. Slaves worked long hours and had to obey the plantation owner. Even though Seth was just a child, he still had many jobs to do. Every chore was important work that had to be finished.

---

While Seth slept, he thought about his two older brothers. They now worked on a different plantation that grew tobacco instead of rice. George, the older brother, had visited when their mother became sick with swamp fever. George told Seth that tobacco plantations were different from rice plantations. ""On a tobacco plantation, slaves work from sunrise to sunset,"" George had explained. ""You must tend to those tobacco leaves all the time.""
Seth did not like the sound of that at all. On a rice plantation, slaves had certain jobs to finish. When they were done, they could do their own chores. But growing rice was still dangerous work. Rice grows in water, so slaves had to spend hours in swamp-like fields. The water had snakes, alligators, and insects that carried diseases. That's how Seth's mother got swamp fever.

---

The sound of a dog barking woke Seth up. He had been asleep for several hours! When he looked out from under the cloth, he saw stars twinkling in the night sky. He could smell wood burning and hear bullfrogs calling in the darkness.
""Boy am I in trouble!"" Seth said as he jumped down from the wagon. He quietly walked toward the small wooden house where he lived with his parents. First, he would get a talking to from his mother and father. Then, if the field manager noticed he had not come to work in the rice fields, he might be in even bigger trouble. Seth could see his mother sewing his torn pants by candlelight. ""Maybe she'll be too tired to be angry,"" he hoped. Seth knew he would have to admire his friends' games from far away for a long time. As he opened the door, he prepared to face his mother.",,,,,How will Seth most likely feel the next time he wants to play hide-and-seek with his friends?,MCQ,angry,confused,excited,hesitant,D,"Good try!

        Seth was playing hide-and-seek with his friends Laura, Helen, and Joseph. ""Seth, it's your turn to hide,"" they called out. Laura was the oldest child. She said, ""We'll count to thirty-three and then add five more seconds.""
""Okay. Turn around now. Don't peek,"" said Seth. The three children turned their backs while Seth ran to find a good hiding spot. None of the children had hidden in the wagon yet. Seth ran to the wagon near the barn and crawled under a giant piece of sack cloth. Soon the three children yelled, ""Ready or not, here we come!""
Seth lay very still in the wagon that was used to transport sacks of rice to town. He could hear his friends running everywhere, searching for him. This was so much fun! Slave children did not get much time to play games.

---

The children looked in the barn, in the cook's kitchen, and in the chicken coop. They did not think to look in the wagon. After searching for a long time, they gave up. ""Seth, we can't find you. You can come out now,"" they called. But Seth did not answer. He was so warm and comfortable under the sack cloth that he had fallen asleep.
When Seth did not come out, the three children ran off to do their work. They knew that if Seth did not appear soon, he would get into a whole heap of trouble. All four children were slaves who lived on a large plantation in South Carolina in 1715. It was called the Walker Plantation. The main crop they grew was rice, and many African slaves knew how to grow rice from their homeland.
Life on the plantation was very hard. Slaves worked long hours and had to obey the plantation owner. Even though Seth was just a child, he still had many jobs to do. Every chore was important work that had to be finished.

---

While Seth slept, he thought about his two older brothers. They now worked on a different plantation that grew tobacco instead of rice. George, the older brother, had visited when their mother became sick with swamp fever. George told Seth that tobacco plantations were different from rice plantations. ""On a tobacco plantation, slaves work from sunrise to sunset,"" George had explained. ""You must tend to those tobacco leaves all the time.""
Seth did not like the sound of that at all. On a rice plantation, slaves had certain jobs to finish. When they were done, they could do their own chores. But growing rice was still dangerous work. Rice grows in water, so slaves had to spend hours in swamp-like fields. The water had snakes, alligators, and insects that carried diseases. That's how Seth's mother got swamp fever.

---

The sound of a dog barking woke Seth up. He had been asleep for several hours! When he looked out from under the cloth, he saw stars twinkling in the night sky. He could smell wood burning and hear bullfrogs calling in the darkness.
""Boy am I in trouble!"" Seth said as he jumped down from the wagon. He quietly walked toward the small wooden house where he lived with his parents. First, he would get a talking to from his mother and father. Then, if the field manager noticed he had not come to work in the rice fields, he might be in even bigger trouble. Seth could see his mother sewing his torn pants by candlelight. ""Maybe she'll be too tired to be angry,"" he hoped.

        Seth was playing hide-and-seek with his friends Laura, Helen, and Joseph. ""Seth, it's your turn to hide,"" they called out. Laura was the oldest child. She said, ""We'll count to thirty-three and then add five more seconds.""
""Okay. Turn around now. Don't peek,"" said Seth. The three children turned their backs while Seth ran to find a good hiding spot. None of the children had hidden in the wagon yet. Seth ran to the wagon near the barn and crawled under a giant piece of sack cloth. Soon the three children yelled, ""Ready or not, here we come!""
Seth lay very still in the wagon that was used to transport sacks of rice to town. He could hear his friends running everywhere, searching for him. This was so much fun! Slave children did not get much time to play games.

---

The children looked in the barn, in the cook's kitchen, and in the chicken coop. They did not think to look in the wagon. After searching for a long time, they gave up. ""Seth, we can't find you. You can come out now,"" they called. But Seth did not answer. He was so warm and comfortable under the sack cloth that he had fallen asleep.
When Seth did not come out, the three children ran off to do their work. They knew that if Seth did not appear soon, he would get into a whole heap of trouble. All four children were slaves who lived on a large plantation in South Carolina in 1715. It was called the Walker Plantation. The main crop they grew was rice, and many African slaves knew how to grow rice from their homeland.
Life on the plantation was very hard. Slaves worked long hours and had to obey the plantation owner. Even though Seth was just a child, he still had many jobs to do. Every chore was important work that had to be finished.

---

While Seth slept, he thought about his two older brothers. They now worked on a different plantation that grew tobacco instead of rice. George, the older brother, had visited when their mother became sick with swamp fever. George told Seth that tobacco plantations were different from rice plantations. ""On a tobacco plantation, slaves work from sunrise to sunset,"" George had explained. ""You must tend to those tobacco leaves all the time.""
Seth did not like the sound of that at all. On a rice plantation, slaves had certain jobs to finish. When they were done, they could do their own chores. But growing rice was still dangerous work. Rice grows in water, so slaves had to spend hours in swamp-like fields. The water had snakes, alligators, and insects that carried diseases. That's how Seth's mother got swamp fever.

Seth ran to the wagon near the barn and crawled under a giant piece of sack cloth. Soon the three children yelled, ""Ready or not, here we come!""
Seth lay very still in the wagon that was used to transport sacks of rice to town. He could hear his friends running everywhere, searching for him. This was so much fun! Slave children did not get much time to play games.

---

The children looked in the barn, in the cook's kitchen, and in the chicken coop. They did not think to look in the wagon. After searching for a long time, they gave up. ""Seth, we can't find you. You can come out now,"" they called. But Seth did not answer. He was so warm and comfortable under the sack cloth that he had fallen asleep.
When Seth did not come out, the three children ran off to do their work. They knew that if Seth did not appear soon, he would get into a whole heap of trouble. All four children were slaves who lived on a large plantation in South Carolina in 1715. It was called the Walker Plantation. The main crop they grew was rice, and many African slaves knew how to grow rice from their homeland.
Life on the plantation was very hard. Slaves worked long hours and had to obey the plantation owner. Even though Seth was just a child, he still had many jobs to do. Every chore was important work that had to be finished.

---

While Seth slept, he thought about his two older brothers. They now worked on a different plantation that grew tobacco instead of rice. George, the older brother, had visited when their mother became sick with swamp fever. George told Seth that tobacco plantations were different from rice plantations. ""On a tobacco plantation, slaves work from sunrise to sunset,"" George had explained. ""You must tend to those tobacco leaves all the time.""
Seth did not like the sound of that at all. On a rice plantation, slaves had certain jobs to finish. When they were done, they could do their own chores. But growing rice was still dangerous work. Rice grows in water, so slaves had to spend hours in swamp-like fields. The water had snakes, alligators, and insects that carried diseases. That's how Seth's mother got swamp fever.

---

The sound of a dog barking woke Seth up. He had been asleep for several hours! When he looked out from under the cloth, he saw stars twinkling in the night sky. He could smell wood burning and hear bullfrogs calling in the darkness.
""Boy am I in trouble!"" Seth said as he jumped down from the wagon. He quietly walked toward the small wooden house where he lived with his parents. First, he would get a talking to from his mother and father. Then, if the field manager noticed he had not come to work in the rice fields, he might be in even bigger trouble. Seth could see his mother sewing his torn pants by candlelight. ""Maybe she'll be too tired to be angry,"" he hoped.

        Hello, my name is Sarah. My family and I are from England. We have been in Savannah, Georgia, for five years now. We left England in November 1737 on a sailing ship called the Anne. It took us two months to reach these shores. I will never forget how bitterly cold it was on the deck of the ship. The wind stung my face like an angry bee. The waves were dark, gray, and scary. They tossed our ship around everywhere. I was afraid those giant waves would devour us completely.
Our first stop in North America was Charleston. After that, we traveled to the town where I now live called Savannah. Savannah is in the English colony of Georgia. It's not quite a real town yet, like the ones back in England, but it will be someday. When we first arrived in Savannah, my mother called it a wilderness. I was six years old then. Now I am eleven.

---

Mr. James Oglethorpe and twenty-one other English gentlemen had been granted a charter by King George II of England. The charter gave them permission to create an English colony under English law. The charter says that they are the trustees, or governors, of this colony. This means they are in charge. However, everyone knows that it is really Mr. Oglethorpe who makes all the decisions. I have also heard that Mr. Oglethorpe wants this colony to succeed so much that he sold some of his own property in England to earn money for Georgia.
Mr. Oglethorpe is a personal friend of the king. He convinced the king to create this colony. My father said that Mr. Oglethorpe intends to bring debtors here too. When I asked him what debtors were, he told me that they are people who owe money to other people. This money they owe is called debt. Often debtors go to jail until they can pay off their debts. They can even die in jail. Mr. Oglethorpe wants some of these people to be given a second chance here in Georgia.

---

My parents aren't debtors. They were chosen by Mr. Oglethorpe for their skills. My father is a carpenter and my mother is a seamstress. Mr. Oglethorpe wanted mostly skilled people to come to Savannah. He said that would be the only way we would survive here. The grownups talk about what happened to the first settlers in Virginia. Some of them died because they were not skilled enough. Many others died because of cold and hunger. So Mr. Oglethorpe and the other trustees chose mostly farmers, merchants, bakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths to be the first English colonists here.
When we first arrived in Savannah, we lived in tents. There were forty families altogether. We worked very hard to build the wall that now surrounds us. Inside the wall, we built our homes. Everyone worked, even the children. Slowly, our town began to take shape.

---

        Hello, my name is Sarah. My family and I are from England. We have been in Savannah, Georgia, for five years now. We left England in November 1737 on a sailing ship called the Anne. It took us two months to reach these shores. I will never forget how bitterly cold it was on the deck of the ship. The wind stung my face like an angry bee. The waves were dark, gray, and scary. They tossed our ship around everywhere. I was afraid those giant waves would devour us completely.
Our first stop in North America was Charleston. After that, we traveled to the town where I now live called Savannah. Savannah is in the English colony of Georgia. It's not quite a real town yet, like the ones back in England, but it will be someday. When we first arrived in Savannah, my mother called it a wilderness. I was six years old then. Now I am eleven.

Mr. James Oglethorpe and twenty-one other English gentlemen had been granted a charter by King George II of England. The charter gave them permission to create an English colony under English law. The charter says that they are the trustees, or governors, of this colony. This means they are in charge. However, everyone knows that it is really Mr. Oglethorpe who makes all the decisions. I have also heard that Mr. Oglethorpe wants this colony to succeed so much that he sold some of his own property in England to earn money for Georgia.
Mr. Oglethorpe is a personal friend of the king. He convinced the king to create this colony. My father said that Mr. Oglethorpe intends to bring debtors here too. When I asked him what debtors were, he told me that they are people who owe money to other people. This money they owe is called debt. Often debtors go to jail until they can pay off their debts. They can even die in jail. Mr. Oglethorpe wants some of these people to be given a second chance here in Georgia.

My parents aren't debtors. They were chosen by Mr. Oglethorpe for their skills. My father is a carpenter and my mother is a seamstress. Mr. Oglethorpe wanted mostly skilled people to come to Savannah. He said that would be the only way we would survive here. The grownups talk about what happened to the first settlers in Virginia. Some of them died because they were not skilled enough. Many others died because of cold and hunger. So Mr. Oglethorpe and the other trustees chose mostly farmers, merchants, bakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths to be the first English colonists here.
When we first arrived in Savannah, we lived in tents. There were forty families altogether. We worked very hard to build the wall that now surrounds us. Inside the wall, we built our homes. Everyone worked, even the children. Slowly, our town began to take shape.

        Hello, my name is Sarah. My family and I are from England. We have been in Savannah, Georgia, for five years now. We left England in November 1737 on a sailing ship called the Anne. It took us two months to reach these shores. I will never forget how bitterly cold it was on the deck of the ship. The wind stung my face like an angry bee. The waves were dark, gray, and scary. They tossed our ship around everywhere. I was afraid those giant waves would devour us completely.
Our first stop in North America was Charleston. After that, we traveled to the town where I now live called Savannah. Savannah is in the English colony of Georgia. It's not quite a real town yet, like the ones back in England, but it will be someday. When we first arrived in Savannah, my mother called it a wilderness. I was six years old then. Now I am eleven.

Mr. James Oglethorpe and twenty-one other English gentlemen had been granted a charter by King George II of England. The charter gave them permission to create an English colony under English law. The charter says that they are the trustees, or governors, of this colony. This means they are in charge. However, everyone knows that it is really Mr. Oglethorpe who makes all the decisions. I have also heard that Mr. Oglethorpe wants this colony to succeed so much that he sold some of his own property in England to earn money for Georgia.
Mr. Oglethorpe is a personal friend of the king. He convinced the king to create this colony. My father said that Mr. Oglethorpe intends to bring debtors here too. When I asked him what debtors were, he told me that they are people who owe money to other people. This money they owe is called debt. Often debtors go to jail until they can pay off their debts. They can even die in jail. Mr. Oglethorpe wants some of these people to be given a second chance here in Georgia.

My parents aren't debtors. They were chosen by Mr. Oglethorpe for their skills. My father is a carpenter and my mother is a seamstress. Mr. Oglethorpe wanted mostly skilled people to come to Savannah. He said that would be the only way we would survive here. The grownups talk about what happened to the first settlers in Virginia. Some of them died because they were not skilled enough. Many others died because of cold and hunger. So Mr. Oglethorpe and the other trustees chose mostly farmers, merchants, bakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths to be the first English colonists here.

When I asked him what debtors were, he told me that they are people who owe money to other people. This money they owe is called debt. Often debtors go to jail until they can pay off their debts. They can even die in jail. Mr. Oglethorpe wants some of these people to be given a second chance here in Georgia.

My parents aren't debtors. They were chosen by Mr. Oglethorpe for their skills. My father is a carpenter and my mother is a seamstress. Mr. Oglethorpe wanted mostly skilled people to come to Savannah. He said that would be the only way we would survive here. The grownups talk about what happened to the first settlers in Virginia. Some of them died because they were not skilled enough. Many others died because of cold and hunger. So Mr. Oglethorpe and the other trustees chose mostly farmers, merchants, bakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths to be the first English colonists here.
When we first arrived in Savannah, we lived in tents. There were forty families altogether. We worked very hard to build the wall that now surrounds us. Inside the wall, we built our homes. Everyone worked, even the children. Slowly, our town began to take shape.

        Hello, my name is Sarah. My family and I are from England. We have been in Savannah, Georgia, for five years now. We left England in November 1737 on a sailing ship called the Anne. It took us two months to reach these shores. I will never forget how bitterly cold it was on the deck of the ship. The wind stung my face like an angry bee. The waves were dark, gray, and scary. They tossed our ship around everywhere. I was afraid those giant waves would devour us completely.
Our first stop in North America was Charleston. After that, we traveled to the town where I now live called Savannah. Savannah is in the English colony of Georgia. It's not quite a real town yet, like the ones back in England, but it will be someday. When we first arrived in Savannah, my mother called it a wilderness. I was six years old then. Now I am eleven.

        Mary and Remember Allerton ran as fast as they could toward their house. Their stepmother, Mrs. Fear Allerton, was waiting for them. As their father had said many times, it was not smart to keep a woman whose name was Fear waiting.
That afternoon, the children had gone out to collect firewood. After gathering the wood, they had stopped to play in the forest with their friends, Love and Wrestling Brewster. Love and Wrestling were Pilgrim brothers who had also come to collect firewood. Like many Pilgrim children, these children had been given special names at birth. Their names often indicate what kind of person their parents hoped they would become.
Remember had been given her name because her mother said she would always remember her birth. Wrestling wasn't happy with his name. He didn't feel like a wrestler at all. Wrestling planned to change his name to John when he got older. He had been a weak baby, and his father gave him the name hoping it would make him strong.

---

The children had gathered firewood and dropped it in a large pile to play hide and seek. They climbed trees and collected sweet berries to eat. They pretended to be English pirates capturing Spanish ships filled with gold. When the sun began to set, they realized they had been gone for a long time. The children anxiously gathered up their firewood and hurried home.
Four years earlier, all four children had survived the journey on the Mayflower from England. They had arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1621. Their parents were English Separatists. English Separatists were people who were unhappy with the Church of England and wanted to start their own church. They wanted to be free to worship God in their own way.

---

The king of England, James I, was the head of the Church of England. He would harass anyone who did not follow the church rules. This was a threat to the English Separatists. As a result, many English Separatists left England. The children's families had first tried living in the Netherlands, but they were not happy there. Finally, they set out across the Atlantic Ocean to start their own colony in North America. Because they were willing to travel to a faraway place for their religious beliefs, they began calling themselves Pilgrims.
The journey across the ocean and the first winter in the colony was now just a terrible memory. So many people had died either on the ship or within the first months in Plymouth. They died from sickness, hunger, and extremely cold weather. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had to witness the death of many Pilgrims. Worst of all was the death of the girls' beloved mother.

---

After their mother died, their father tried to comfort them as best he could. The girls felt that their hearts were broken. Their brother Bartholomew had hidden in the forest for several days. He refused to come back no matter how often they called his name. When spring arrived, Bartholomew helped their father build a house and plant crops.
The Pilgrims had not planned to settle in Plymouth. They had been planning to go to Virginia, but their ship had been blown off course. When they finally arrived, it was winter and they were in an unknown land hundreds of miles north of where they wanted to go. This place was much colder than Virginia, and the soil was not very good for farming.

Four years earlier, all four children had survived the journey on the Mayflower from England. They had arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1621. Their parents were English Separatists. English Separatists were people who were unhappy with the Church of England and wanted to start their own church. They wanted to be free to worship God in their own way.

The king of England, James I, was the head of the Church of England. He would harass anyone who did not follow the church rules. This was a threat to the English Separatists. As a result, many English Separatists left England. The children's families had first tried living in the Netherlands, but they were not happy there. Finally, they set out across the Atlantic Ocean to start their own colony in North America. Because they were willing to travel to a faraway place for their religious beliefs, they began calling themselves Pilgrims.
The journey across the ocean and the first winter in the colony was now just a terrible memory. So many people had died either on the ship or within the first months in Plymouth. They died from sickness, hunger, and extremely cold weather. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had to witness the death of many Pilgrims. Worst of all was the death of the girls' beloved mother.

He refused to come back no matter how often they called his name. When spring arrived, Bartholomew helped their father build a house and plant crops.
The Pilgrims had not planned to settle in Plymouth. They had been planning to go to Virginia, but their ship had been blown off course.

        Mary and Remember Allerton ran as fast as they could toward their house. Their stepmother, Mrs. Fear Allerton, was waiting for them. As their father had said many times, it was not smart to keep a woman whose name was Fear waiting.
That afternoon, the children had gone out to collect firewood. After gathering the wood, they had stopped to play in the forest with their friends, Love and Wrestling Brewster. Love and Wrestling were Pilgrim brothers who had also come to collect firewood. Like many Pilgrim children, these children had been given special names at birth.

They pretended to be English pirates capturing Spanish ships filled with gold. When the sun began to set, they realized they had been gone for a long time. The children anxiously gathered up their firewood and hurried home.
Four years earlier, all four children had survived the journey on the Mayflower from England. They had arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1621. Their parents were English Separatists. English Separatists were people who were unhappy with the Church of England and wanted to start their own church. They wanted to be free to worship God in their own way.

The king of England, James I, was the head of the Church of England. He would harass anyone who did not follow the church rules. This was a threat to the English Separatists. As a result, many English Separatists left England. The children's families had first tried living in the Netherlands, but they were not happy there. Finally, they set out across the Atlantic Ocean to start their own colony in North America. Because they were willing to travel to a faraway place for their religious beliefs, they began calling themselves Pilgrims.
The journey across the ocean and the first winter in the colony was now just a terrible memory. So many people had died either on the ship or within the first months in Plymouth. They died from sickness, hunger, and extremely cold weather. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had to witness the death of many Pilgrims. Worst of all was the death of the girls' beloved mother.

After their mother died, their father tried to comfort them as best he could. The girls felt that their hearts were broken. Their brother Bartholomew had hidden in the forest for several days. He refused to come back no matter how often they called his name. When spring arrived, Bartholomew helped their father build a house and plant crops.
The Pilgrims had not planned to settle in Plymouth. They had been planning to go to Virginia, but their ship had been blown off course.

        Mary and Remember Allerton ran as fast as they could toward their house. Their stepmother, Mrs. Fear Allerton, was waiting for them. As their father had said many times, it was not smart to keep a woman whose name was Fear waiting.
That afternoon, the children had gone out to collect firewood. After gathering the wood, they had stopped to play in the forest with their friends, Love and Wrestling Brewster. Love and Wrestling were Pilgrim brothers who had also come to collect firewood. Like many Pilgrim children, these children had been given special names at birth. Their names often indicate what kind of person their parents hoped they would become.
Remember had been given her name because her mother said she would always remember her birth. Wrestling wasn't happy with his name. He didn't feel like a wrestler at all. Wrestling planned to change his name to John when he got older. He had been a weak baby, and his father gave him the name hoping it would make him strong.

English Separatists were people who were unhappy with the Church of England and wanted to start their own church. They wanted to be free to worship God in their own way.

---

The king of England, James I, was the head of the Church of England. He would harass anyone who did not follow the church rules. This was a threat to the English Separatists. As a result, many English Separatists left England. The children's families had first tried living in the Netherlands, but they were not happy there. Finally, they set out across the Atlantic Ocean to start their own colony in North America. Because they were willing to travel to a faraway place for their religious beliefs, they began calling themselves Pilgrims.
The journey across the ocean and the first winter in the colony was now just a terrible memory. So many people had died either on the ship or within the first months in Plymouth. They died from sickness, hunger, and extremely cold weather. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had to witness the death of many Pilgrims. Worst of all was the death of the girls' beloved mother.

---

After their mother died, their father tried to comfort them as best he could. The girls felt that their hearts were broken. Their brother Bartholomew had hidden in the forest for several days. He refused to come back no matter how often they called his name. When spring arrived, Bartholomew helped their father build a house and plant crops.
The Pilgrims had not planned to settle in Plymouth. They had been planning to go to Virginia, but their ship had been blown off course. When they finally arrived, it was winter and they were in an unknown land hundreds of miles north of where they wanted to go.

        Mary and Remember Allerton ran as fast as they could toward their house. Their stepmother, Mrs. Fear Allerton, was waiting for them. As their father had said many times, it was not smart to keep a woman whose name was Fear waiting.
That afternoon, the children had gone out to collect firewood. After gathering the wood, they had stopped to play in the forest with their friends, Love and Wrestling Brewster. Love and Wrestling were Pilgrim brothers who had also come to collect firewood. Like many Pilgrim children, these children had been given special names at birth. Their names often indicate what kind of person their parents hoped they would become.
Remember had been given her name because her mother said she would always remember her birth. Wrestling wasn't happy with his name. He didn't feel like a wrestler at all. Wrestling planned to change his name to John when he got older. He had been a weak baby, and his father gave him the name hoping it would make him strong.

        Do you remember the Pilgrim children Mary and Remember Allerton and Love and Wrestling Brewster? In the last chapter, they were collecting firewood and playing in the forest. Then you learned how they arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts. In this chapter, we will find out more about their early life in Plymouth.
Years earlier, when the children and other Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in 1621, they were not alone. Native Americans had watched them from the forest. They watched as these foreigners worked to build shelters during the day and returned to their ship at night to sleep. They watched as the newcomers shivered in the cold. They watched as they buried their dead in the quiet of the night. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had watched too, and wondered if they would survive.

---

Although there were many hardships, two things helped them survive. A native tribe called the Patuxet had lived in the area and created fields for planting. Sadly, many members of this tribe had died because they caught diseases from European explorers. Because of this, their fields were empty. This meant that the hungry English colonists did not have to clear the forests before planting time.
A Native American called Squanto came to help the Pilgrims. His friend Samoset helped too. Both men spoke English very well. In 1605, Squanto had been taken to England by an English explorer. Squanto and Samoset showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn, squash, and beans. They taught them how to make crops grow in the poor soil. Squanto also taught people which berries and fruits were safe to eat and where the best fishing spots were. Wrestling Brewster often said he had feared these people at first, but when they helped the settlers, he changed his mind.

---

The colonists also made peace with a local tribe called the Wampanoag. Both sides agreed to help and protect each other. They agreed to trade with each other too. This meant the colonists could build their homes without fear of attack.
Slowly, the days grew warmer and the Pilgrims became happier. The first fall was one of the most precious memories the children had. The crops had grown well and their harvest was abundant. The colonists had also learned how to hunt and fish in this new land. They had produced more than enough food to get through the next winter. They had built homes that would protect them from cold weather. While they mourned those who had died, the surviving colonists were thankful for what they had. That is why they decided to give thanks to God and the native people who had helped them.

---

A great celebration of thanksgiving was organized. The local Wampanoag were invited to the thanksgiving celebration. Squanto and Samoset were invited too. The Wampanoag chief, Massasoit, was the guest of honor. Everyone dined on deer, duck, lobster, fish, cornbread, pumpkin, squash, and berries. They played games and ran races. The Wampanoag stayed in the colony for several days. It was probably the happiest time the children could remember.
Since then, more Pilgrims had arrived. More homes had been built. Their father had married Mistress Fear. All these early experiences happened four years ago. Now the children were playing in a forest in a new world. Even though the Mayflower had gone off course from its original destination, Plymouth had become their home. As Mary and Remember hurried out of the forest, they said goodbye to Love and Wrestling. Minutes later they arrived at their house door.

Squanto also taught people which berries and fruits were safe to eat and where the best fishing spots were. Wrestling Brewster often said he had feared these people at first, but when they helped the settlers, he changed his mind.

---

The colonists also made peace with a local tribe called the Wampanoag. Both sides agreed to help and protect each other. They agreed to trade with each other too. This meant the colonists could build their homes without fear of attack.
Slowly, the days grew warmer and the Pilgrims became happier. The first fall was one of the most precious memories the children had. The crops had grown well and their harvest was abundant. The colonists had also learned how to hunt and fish in this new land. They had produced more than enough food to get through the next winter. They had built homes that would protect them from cold weather. While they mourned those who had died, the surviving colonists were thankful for what they had. That is why they decided to give thanks to God and the native people who had helped them.

A great celebration of thanksgiving was organized. The local Wampanoag were invited to the thanksgiving celebration. Squanto and Samoset were invited too. The Wampanoag chief, Massasoit, was the guest of honor. Everyone dined on deer, duck, lobster, fish, cornbread, pumpkin, squash, and berries. They played games and ran races. The Wampanoag stayed in the colony for several days. It was probably the happiest time the children could remember.
Since then, more Pilgrims had arrived. More homes had been built. Their father had married Mistress Fear. All these early experiences happened four years ago. Now the children were playing in a forest in a new world. Even though the Mayflower had gone off course from its original destination, Plymouth had become their home.

        Do you remember the Pilgrim children Mary and Remember Allerton and Love and Wrestling Brewster? In the last chapter, they were collecting firewood and playing in the forest. Then you learned how they arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts. In this chapter, we will find out more about their early life in Plymouth.
Years earlier, when the children and other Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in 1621, they were not alone. Native Americans had watched them from the forest. They watched as these foreigners worked to build shelters during the day and returned to their ship at night to sleep. They watched as the newcomers shivered in the cold. They watched as they buried their dead in the quiet of the night. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had watched too, and wondered if they would survive.

---

Although there were many hardships, two things helped them survive. A native tribe called the Patuxet had lived in the area and created fields for planting. Sadly, many members of this tribe had died because they caught diseases from European explorers. Because of this, their fields were empty. This meant that the hungry English colonists did not have to clear the forests before planting time.

Years earlier, when the children and other Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in 1621, they were not alone. Native Americans had watched them from the forest. They watched as these foreigners worked to build shelters during the day and returned to their ship at night to sleep. They watched as the newcomers shivered in the cold. They watched as they buried their dead in the quiet of the night. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had watched too, and wondered if they would survive.

---

Although there were many hardships, two things helped them survive. A native tribe called the Patuxet had lived in the area and created fields for planting. Sadly, many members of this tribe had died because they caught diseases from European explorers. Because of this, their fields were empty. This meant that the hungry English colonists did not have to clear the forests before planting time.
A Native American called Squanto came to help the Pilgrims. His friend Samoset helped too. Both men spoke English very well. In 1605, Squanto had been taken to England by an English explorer. Squanto and Samoset showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn, squash, and beans. They taught them how to make crops grow in the poor soil. Squanto also taught people which berries and fruits were safe to eat and where the best fishing spots were. Wrestling Brewster often said he had feared these people at first, but when they helped the settlers, he changed his mind.

---

The colonists also made peace with a local tribe called the Wampanoag. Both sides agreed to help and protect each other. They agreed to trade with each other too. This meant the colonists could build their homes without fear of attack.
Slowly, the days grew warmer and the Pilgrims became happier. The first fall was one of the most precious memories the children had. The crops had grown well and their harvest was abundant. The colonists had also learned how to hunt and fish in this new land. They had produced more than enough food to get through the next winter. They had built homes that would protect them from cold weather. While they mourned those who had died, the surviving colonists were thankful for what they had. That is why they decided to give thanks to God and the native people who had helped them.

---

A great celebration of thanksgiving was organized. The local Wampanoag were invited to the thanksgiving celebration. Squanto and Samoset were invited too. The Wampanoag chief, Massasoit, was the guest of honor. Everyone dined on deer, duck, lobster, fish, cornbread, pumpkin, squash, and berries. They played games and ran races. The Wampanoag stayed in the colony for several days. It was probably the happiest time the children could remember.
Since then, more Pilgrims had arrived. More homes had been built. Their father had married Mistress Fear. All these early experiences happened four years ago. Now the children were playing in a forest in a new world. Even though the Mayflower had gone off course from its original destination, Plymouth had become their home. As Mary and Remember hurried out of the forest, they said goodbye to Love and Wrestling. Minutes later they arrived at their house door.

        Do you remember the Pilgrim children Mary and Remember Allerton and Love and Wrestling Brewster? In the last chapter, they were collecting firewood and playing in the forest. Then you learned how they arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts. In this chapter, we will find out more about their early life in Plymouth.
Years earlier, when the children and other Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in 1621, they were not alone. Native Americans had watched them from the forest. They watched as these foreigners worked to build shelters during the day and returned to their ship at night to sleep. They watched as the newcomers shivered in the cold. They watched as they buried their dead in the quiet of the night. Mary, Remember, Love, and Wrestling had watched too, and wondered if they would survive.

---

Although there were many hardships, two things helped them survive. A native tribe called the Patuxet had lived in the area and created fields for planting. Sadly, many members of this tribe had died because they caught diseases from European explorers. Because of this, their fields were empty. This meant that the hungry English colonists did not have to clear the forests before planting time.
A Native American called Squanto came to help the Pilgrims. His friend Samoset helped too. Both men spoke English very well. In 1605, Squanto had been taken to England by an English explorer. Squanto and Samoset showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn, squash, and beans. They taught them how to make crops grow in the poor soil. Squanto also taught people which berries and fruits were safe to eat and where the best fishing spots were. Wrestling Brewster often said he had feared these people at first, but when they helped the settlers, he changed his mind.

---

The colonists also made peace with a local tribe called the Wampanoag. Both sides agreed to help and protect each other. They agreed to trade with each other too. This meant the colonists could build their homes without fear of attack.
Slowly, the days grew warmer and the Pilgrims became happier. The first fall was one of the most precious memories the children had. The crops had grown well and their harvest was abundant. The colonists had also learned how to hunt and fish in this new land. They had produced more than enough food to get through the next winter. They had built homes that would protect them from cold weather. While they mourned those who had died, the surviving colonists were thankful for what they had. That is why they decided to give thanks to God and the native people who had helped them.

---

A great celebration of thanksgiving was organized. The local Wampanoag were invited to the thanksgiving celebration. Squanto and Samoset were invited too. The Wampanoag chief, Massasoit, was the guest of honor. Everyone dined on deer, duck, lobster, fish, cornbread, pumpkin, squash, and berries. They played games and ran races. The Wampanoag stayed in the colony for several days. It was probably the happiest time the children could remember.
Since then, more Pilgrims had arrived. More homes had been built. Their father had married Mistress Fear. All these early experiences happened four years ago. Now the children were playing in a forest in a new world. Even though the Mayflower had gone off course from its original destination, Plymouth had become their home. As Mary and Remember hurried out of the forest, they said goodbye to Love and Wrestling. Minutes later they arrived at their house door.

        Hello, my name is Lizzie. I am a Puritan child living in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. My mother and father are upset with me again. I smiled too much during the morning sermon, and then I fell asleep during the afternoon sermon. They said it is a great sin for a Puritan child to fall asleep while listening to God's word from the Bible.
During the morning sermon, I smiled when I saw Elder Jones's new wig. I could not understand why a minister of the church would want to wear such a strange thing on his head. It did not sit straight and looked very funny. When I smiled and pointed at him, my mother pinched me so hard that my leg still hurts. I know I must mend my ways and be better.

The most important place for any Puritan is the meeting house. Every meeting house sits in the center of our town. That is because the meeting house is the center of our lives. Our church services happen there, and so do all important meetings. The Elder likes to preach there for many hours.
We Puritans live in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Our colony works with the Massachusetts Bay Company. The company sells the fur we get from hunting and the fish we catch. Our colony is becoming wealthy because of this trading. We came here from England in 1630 when I was just a baby. Now I am almost eleven years old. Unlike the Pilgrims, we did not want to break away from the Church of England. We wanted the church to be more pure and stronger. But King James I and his son King Charles I would not listen to us. We had no choice but to leave our homeland and start a new life. We chose to create our own colony north of Plymouth. Our leader John Winthrop guided us to this new land.

Trade ships often come in and out of our harbor. I love to watch the men unload items sent from across the ocean. We need guns, tools, and cloth. We hear news from home by talking to sailors and new colonists. It makes our hearts flutter when they talk about life in England. Just two months ago, I sat on the snow-covered dock and listened to stories from home. The sailors spoke of the glorious sound of London church bells ringing on Christmas Day. They told us about the smell of roasting pheasant and sweet plum pudding. Some of us feel homesick, but we know our cause is good and worth the sacrifice.

        Hello, my name is Lizzie. I am a Puritan child living in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. My mother and father are upset with me again. I smiled too much during the morning sermon, and then I fell asleep during the afternoon sermon. They said it is a great sin for a Puritan child to fall asleep while listening to God's word from the Bible.
During the morning sermon, I smiled when I saw Elder Jones's new wig. I could not understand why a minister of the church would want to wear such a strange thing on his head. It did not sit straight and looked very funny. When I smiled and pointed at him, my mother pinched me so hard that my leg still hurts. I know I must mend my ways and be better.

The most important place for any Puritan is the meeting house. Every meeting house sits in the center of our town. That is because the meeting house is the center of our lives. Our church services happen there, and so do all important meetings. The Elder likes to preach there for many hours.
We Puritans live in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Our colony works with the Massachusetts Bay Company. The company sells the fur we get from hunting and the fish we catch. Our colony is becoming wealthy because of this trading. We came here from England in 1630 when I was just a baby. Now I am almost eleven years old. Unlike the Pilgrims, we did not want to break away from the Church of England. We wanted the church to be more pure and stronger. But King James I and his son King Charles I would not listen to us. We had no choice but to leave our homeland and start a new life. We chose to create our own colony north of Plymouth. Our leader John Winthrop guided us to this new land.

Trade ships often come in and out of our harbor. I love to watch the men unload items sent from across the ocean. We need guns, tools, and cloth. We hear news from home by talking to sailors and new colonists. It makes our hearts flutter when they talk about life in England. Just two months ago, I sat on the snow-covered dock and listened to stories from home. The sailors spoke of the glorious sound of London church bells ringing on Christmas Day. They told us about the smell of roasting pheasant and sweet plum pudding. Some of us feel homesick, but we know our cause is good and worth the sacrifice.

        Hello, my name is Lizzie. I am a Puritan child living in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. My mother and father are upset with me again. I smiled too much during the morning sermon, and then I fell asleep during the afternoon sermon. They said it is a great sin for a Puritan child to fall asleep while listening to God's word from the Bible.
During the morning sermon, I smiled when I saw Elder Jones's new wig. I could not understand why a minister of the church would want to wear such a strange thing on his head. It did not sit straight and looked very funny. When I smiled and pointed at him, my mother pinched me so hard that my leg still hurts. I know I must mend my ways and be better.

The most important place for any Puritan is the meeting house. Every meeting house sits in the center of our town. That is because the meeting house is the center of our lives. Our church services happen there, and so do all important meetings. The Elder likes to preach there for many hours.
We Puritans live in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Our colony works with the Massachusetts Bay Company. The company sells the fur we get from hunting and the fish we catch. Our colony is becoming wealthy because of this trading. We came here from England in 1630 when I was just a baby. Now I am almost eleven years old. Unlike the Pilgrims, we did not want to break away from the Church of England. We wanted the church to be more pure and stronger. But King James I and his son King Charles I would not listen to us. We had no choice but to leave our homeland and start a new life. We chose to create our own colony north of Plymouth. Our leader John Winthrop guided us to this new land.

---

Trade ships often come in and out of our harbor. I love to watch the men unload items sent from across the ocean. We need guns, tools, and cloth. We hear news from home by talking to sailors and new colonists. It makes our hearts flutter when they talk about life in England. Just two months ago, I sat on the snow-covered dock and listened to stories from home. The sailors spoke of the glorious sound of London church bells ringing on Christmas Day. They told us about the smell of roasting pheasant and sweet plum pudding. Some of us feel homesick, but we know our cause is good and worth the sacrifice.

        ""Primrose, come see the kittens that have just been born!"" called Patience to her sister. ""Look, there are six of them,"" Patience said as Primrose came to her side.
Primrose sat down next to Patience under a large bush. The mother cat and her babies lay together in a warm pile. The two girls looked at the tiny creatures that looked more like little rats than kittens. All six kittens had their eyes closed and could not walk yet. They stayed close to their mother.
""I want to keep one as my pet,"" said Patience.
""You can't do that yet,"" Primrose said. ""The kittens must stay with their mother for ten or eleven weeks. Then you have to ask Mama and Papa. They will say no because they don't like animals inside the house.""
""I'll hide it somewhere safe,"" Patience said.
""Where will you hide it?"" asked Primrose. ""I can't think of any place that Mama and Papa wouldn't find it. Do you think a kitten will stay in one spot all day? Do you think they won't notice you carrying it around?""
Patience thought for a while. ""The kitten will stay hidden if I train her to,"" she finally said.

---

The two girls talked about whether they could hide a kitten in their small log cabin. Like many colonial homes, theirs had two small rooms downstairs and three tiny bedrooms upstairs. Primrose and Patience shared one bedroom, and their three brothers shared another.
The girls lived on a farm in southern New Jersey. They and their family were originally from Sweden. They had moved to this English colony because of their Uncle Sven. He had written to their father about the wonderful life they could have in America.
Uncle Sven had traveled to New Jersey from Sweden in 1699. That was thirty years after the English had taken control of this area from the Dutch. Uncle Sven was now a successful wheat farmer.
The girls and their family had arrived in New Jersey in 1701. Primrose and Patience lived with their parents and three brothers on a one hundred acre farm. On their farm, they grew wheat, rye, and barley. They also kept cows, pigs, and chickens.

---

Most people in the Middle Atlantic colonies lived on small farms that were fifty to one hundred fifty acres. These farms were far apart, so neighbors only saw each other at church on Sunday. Sometimes they got together for a special occasion or when someone needed help.
The girls' farm had a house and a large barn. They had a garden where they grew vegetables, berries, and fruits. They also had a small orchard with fruit trees. Their garden had a fence around it, just like the area where they kept their pigs. Each morning, they sent their cows out to graze in the pasture. Each night, they brought the cows back to the barn for milking. Farm animals were very valuable, so they watched them carefully.

---

After a while, the girls' older brother Lars found them by the bush. Their father had sent Lars to look for them. He sat down beside the girls and looked at the kittens.
""You two need to come to the barn,"" Lars said. ""Papa wants you to lead the cows out to the pasture. Then Mama wants you to weed and water the garden. After that, she wants you to help her with the new quilt she is making.""
Primrose and Patience sighed. They knew they had many hours of chores ahead of them. Next week would be even busier because it was spring cleaning week. They would have to help Mama make soap before they cleaned and swept the whole house. Before running off, Patience knelt down and kissed the small pile of newborn kittens. ""I'll be back later,"" she whispered.",,,,,What does Patience want to do first with one of the kittens?,MCQ,She wants to keep it as her pet.,She wants to train it to stay hidden.,She wants to ask her parents for permission.,She wants to wait ten or eleven weeks.,A,"Great job!

The girls lived on a farm in southern New Jersey. They and their family were originally from Sweden. They had moved to this English colony because of their Uncle Sven. He had written to their father about the wonderful life they could have in America.
Uncle Sven had traveled to New Jersey from Sweden in 1699. That was thirty years after the English had taken control of this area from the Dutch. Uncle Sven was now a successful wheat farmer.
The girls and their family had arrived in New Jersey in 1701. Primrose and Patience lived with their parents and three brothers on a one hundred acre farm. On their farm, they grew wheat, rye, and barley. They also kept cows, pigs, and chickens.

---

Most people in the Middle Atlantic colonies lived on small farms that were fifty to one hundred fifty acres. These farms were far apart, so neighbors only saw each other at church on Sunday. Sometimes they got together for a special occasion or when someone needed help.
The girls' farm had a house and a large barn. They had a garden where they grew vegetables, berries, and fruits. They also had a small orchard with fruit trees. Their garden had a fence around it, just like the area where they kept their pigs. Each morning, they sent their cows out to graze in the pasture. Each night, they brought the cows back to the barn for milking. Farm animals were very valuable, so they watched them carefully.

After a while, the girls' older brother Lars found them by the bush. Their father had sent Lars to look for them. He sat down beside the girls and looked at the kittens.
""You two need to come to the barn,"" Lars said. ""Papa wants you to lead the cows out to the pasture. Then Mama wants you to weed and water the garden. After that, she wants you to help her with the new quilt she is making.""
Primrose and Patience sighed. They knew they had many hours of chores ahead of them. Next week would be even busier because it was spring cleaning week. They would have to help Mama make soap before they cleaned and swept the whole house. Before running off, Patience knelt down and kissed the small pile of newborn kittens.

        ""Primrose, come see the kittens that have just been born!"" called Patience to her sister. ""Look, there are six of them,"" Patience said as Primrose came to her side.
Primrose sat down next to Patience under a large bush. The mother cat and her babies lay together in a warm pile. The two girls looked at the tiny creatures that looked more like little rats than kittens. All six kittens had their eyes closed and could not walk yet. They stayed close to their mother.
""I want to keep one as my pet,"" said Patience.
""You can't do that yet,"" Primrose said. ""The kittens must stay with their mother for ten or eleven weeks. Then you have to ask Mama and Papa. They will say no because they don't like animals inside the house.""
""I'll hide it somewhere safe,"" Patience said.
""Where will you hide it?"" asked Primrose. ""I can't think of any place that Mama and Papa wouldn't find it. Do you think a kitten will stay in one spot all day? Do you think they won't notice you carrying it around?""
Patience thought for a while. ""The kitten will stay hidden if I train her to,"" she finally said.

        ""Primrose, come see the kittens that have just been born!"" called Patience to her sister. ""Look, there are six of them,"" Patience said as Primrose came to her side.
Primrose sat down next to Patience under a large bush. The mother cat and her babies lay together in a warm pile. The two girls looked at the tiny creatures that looked more like little rats than kittens. All six kittens had their eyes closed and could not walk yet. They stayed close to their mother.
""I want to keep one as my pet,"" said Patience.
""You can't do that yet,"" Primrose said. ""The kittens must stay with their mother for ten or eleven weeks. Then you have to ask Mama and Papa. They will say no because they don't like animals inside the house.""
""I'll hide it somewhere safe,"" Patience said.
""Where will you hide it?"" asked Primrose. ""I can't think of any place that Mama and Papa wouldn't find it. Do you think a kitten will stay in one spot all day? Do you think they won't notice you carrying it around?""
Patience thought for a while. ""The kitten will stay hidden if I train her to,"" she finally said.

The two girls talked about whether they could hide a kitten in their small log cabin. Like many colonial homes, theirs had two small rooms downstairs and three tiny bedrooms upstairs. Primrose and Patience shared one bedroom, and their three brothers shared another.
The girls lived on a farm in southern New Jersey. They and their family were originally from Sweden. They had moved to this English colony because of their Uncle Sven. He had written to their father about the wonderful life they could have in America.
Uncle Sven had traveled to New Jersey from Sweden in 1699. That was thirty years after the English had taken control of this area from the Dutch. Uncle Sven was now a successful wheat farmer.
The girls and their family had arrived in New Jersey in 1701. Primrose and Patience lived with their parents and three brothers on a one hundred acre farm. On their farm, they grew wheat, rye, and barley. They also kept cows, pigs, and chickens.

---

Most people in the Middle Atlantic colonies lived on small farms that were fifty to one hundred fifty acres. These farms were far apart, so neighbors only saw each other at church on Sunday. Sometimes they got together for a special occasion or when someone needed help.
The girls' farm had a house and a large barn. They had a garden where they grew vegetables, berries, and fruits. They also had a small orchard with fruit trees. Their garden had a fence around it, just like the area where they kept their pigs. Each morning, they sent their cows out to graze in the pasture. Each night, they brought the cows back to the barn for milking. Farm animals were very valuable, so they watched them carefully.

After a while, the girls' older brother Lars found them by the bush. Their father had sent Lars to look for them. He sat down beside the girls and looked at the kittens.
""You two need to come to the barn,"" Lars said. ""Papa wants you to lead the cows out to the pasture. Then Mama wants you to weed and water the garden. After that, she wants you to help her with the new quilt she is making.""
Primrose and Patience sighed. They knew they had many hours of chores ahead of them. Next week would be even busier because it was spring cleaning week.

The two girls talked about whether they could hide a kitten in their small log cabin. Like many colonial homes, theirs had two small rooms downstairs and three tiny bedrooms upstairs. Primrose and Patience shared one bedroom, and their three brothers shared another.
The girls lived on a farm in southern New Jersey. They and their family were originally from Sweden. They had moved to this English colony because of their Uncle Sven. He had written to their father about the wonderful life they could have in America.
Uncle Sven had traveled to New Jersey from Sweden in 1699. That was thirty years after the English had taken control of this area from the Dutch. Uncle Sven was now a successful wheat farmer.
The girls and their family had arrived in New Jersey in 1701. Primrose and Patience lived with their parents and three brothers on a one hundred acre farm. On their farm, they grew wheat, rye, and barley. They also kept cows, pigs, and chickens.

---

Most people in the Middle Atlantic colonies lived on small farms that were fifty to one hundred fifty acres. These farms were far apart, so neighbors only saw each other at church on Sunday. Sometimes they got together for a special occasion or when someone needed help.
The girls' farm had a house and a large barn. They had a garden where they grew vegetables, berries, and fruits. They also had a small orchard with fruit trees. Their garden had a fence around it, just like the area where they kept their pigs. Each morning, they sent their cows out to graze in the pasture. Each night, they brought the cows back to the barn for milking. Farm animals were very valuable, so they watched them carefully.

---

After a while, the girls' older brother Lars found them by the bush. Their father had sent Lars to look for them. He sat down beside the girls and looked at the kittens.
""You two need to come to the barn,"" Lars said. ""Papa wants you to lead the cows out to the pasture. Then Mama wants you to weed and water the garden. After that, she wants you to help her with the new quilt she is making.""
Primrose and Patience sighed. They knew they had many hours of chores ahead of them. Next week would be even busier because it was spring cleaning week. They would have to help Mama make soap before they cleaned and swept the whole house. Before running off, Patience knelt down and kissed the small pile of newborn kittens.

        ""Primrose, come see the kittens that have just been born!"" called Patience to her sister. ""Look, there are six of them,"" Patience said as Primrose came to her side.
Primrose sat down next to Patience under a large bush. The mother cat and her babies lay together in a warm pile. The two girls looked at the tiny creatures that looked more like little rats than kittens. All six kittens had their eyes closed and could not walk yet. They stayed close to their mother.
""I want to keep one as my pet,"" said Patience.
""You can't do that yet,"" Primrose said. ""The kittens must stay with their mother for ten or eleven weeks. Then you have to ask Mama and Papa. They will say no because they don't like animals inside the house.""
""I'll hide it somewhere safe,"" Patience said.
""Where will you hide it?"" asked Primrose. ""I can't think of any place that Mama and Papa wouldn't find it. Do you think a kitten will stay in one spot all day? Do you think they won't notice you carrying it around?""
Patience thought for a while. ""The kitten will stay hidden if I train her to,"" she finally said.

        Do you remember Patience and Primrose from the last chapter? They found something special under a bush. When we left them, they were going to do their chores. Let's see what happened next.
The girls' uncle had given them good advice about the Middle Atlantic colonies. These colonies gave people from Europe new chances and religious freedom. Even though these were English colonies, people from Germany, Holland, France, Sweden, and Ireland came to live in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. Every day, more people arrived to start new lives.

Papa often told the children stories about his trips to town. He described all the different languages people spoke there. He told them about people who came from many parts of Europe. He would occasionally bring home strange foods from the market or from a street vendor. One favorite was English 'pop robbins' - delicious balls made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Papa described the different clothes people wore and the different customs he heard about.
Most of their neighbors came from different parts of Europe. Their closest neighbor was a German family. In the early 1700s, German families had started coming to this colony. At harvest time, their German neighbors cooked scrapple and brought it to their home. The boys loved this dish made of meat and grain. The girls liked it less, but they loved the apple strudel that came after. The family had also visited an Irish family who lived about a mile away. Mama was amazed by how much the Irish family liked butter and cream.

---

Everyone knew that the Middle Atlantic colonies grew more food than the New England colonies. The soil was much better for farming. For this reason, these colonies earned the name 'the breadbasket of the colonies'. They grew huge amounts of rye, barley, and wheat. Farmers sent their grain to water-powered mills across the region. At the mills, grain was turned into flour. The flour was sold to other colonies and to people in the West Indies. It was even sold to English merchants, who shipped it to England.
The Middle Atlantic colonies were known for more than farming. Along the coast, fishermen caught fish and skilled workers built boats and ships. Men cut down trees from forests and turned them into lumber for boats and to ship to England. Because people could worship freely, different churches appeared throughout the Middle Atlantic colonies. There were many Christian churches, including the Lutheran church the girls' family attended. Like the children's family, most Swedish settlers were Lutheran. There were Jewish temples too. Small, one-room schoolhouses were also appearing. Only boys could attend them.

Primrose and Patience went to do their chores. They led the cows into the pasture. The cows followed them obediently along the familiar path. After that, they weeded and watered the newly planted vegetable garden. They stopped only once to drink water from the well and to put on their sun bonnets. They did not talk much as they worked. As they finished their task, Patience looked up and said, ""I know! I will hide my kitten in my pocket. That way, she can come with me everywhere. Her name will be Midnight.""
Primrose looked at her sister and sighed. There was no point disagreeing with her. It was clear that Patience was determined to have a pet kitten. When they finished weeding, Primrose stood up and looked toward their cabin. ""We should go help Mama with the quilt. Now that it is spring, maybe she will make each of us a new dress,"" she said hopefully. Patience's eyes lit up. ""I want a blue dress with a very large pocket,"" she said excitedly.

        Do you remember Patience and Primrose from the last chapter? They found something special under a bush. When we left them, they were going to do their chores. Let's see what happened next.
The girls' uncle had given them good advice about the Middle Atlantic colonies. These colonies gave people from Europe new chances and religious freedom. Even though these were English colonies, people from Germany, Holland, France, Sweden, and Ireland came to live in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. Every day, more people arrived to start new lives.

Papa often told the children stories about his trips to town. He described all the different languages people spoke there. He told them about people who came from many parts of Europe. He would occasionally bring home strange foods from the market or from a street vendor. One favorite was English 'pop robbins' - delicious balls made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Papa described the different clothes people wore and the different customs he heard about.
Most of their neighbors came from different parts of Europe. Their closest neighbor was a German family. In the early 1700s, German families had started coming to this colony. At harvest time, their German neighbors cooked scrapple and brought it to their home. The boys loved this dish made of meat and grain. The girls liked it less, but they loved the apple strudel that came after. The family had also visited an Irish family who lived about a mile away. Mama was amazed by how much the Irish family liked butter and cream.

Everyone knew that the Middle Atlantic colonies grew more food than the New England colonies. The soil was much better for farming. For this reason, these colonies earned the name 'the breadbasket of the colonies'. They grew huge amounts of rye, barley, and wheat. Farmers sent their grain to water-powered mills across the region. At the mills, grain was turned into flour. The flour was sold to other colonies and to people in the West Indies. It was even sold to English merchants, who shipped it to England.
The Middle Atlantic colonies were known for more than farming. Along the coast, fishermen caught fish and skilled workers built boats and ships. Men cut down trees from forests and turned them into lumber for boats and to ship to England. Because people could worship freely, different churches appeared throughout the Middle Atlantic colonies. There were many Christian churches, including the Lutheran church the girls' family attended. Like the children's family, most Swedish settlers were Lutheran. There were Jewish temples too. Small, one-room schoolhouses were also appearing. Only boys could attend them.

Primrose and Patience went to do their chores. They led the cows into the pasture. The cows followed them obediently along the familiar path. After that, they weeded and watered the newly planted vegetable garden. They stopped only once to drink water from the well and to put on their sun bonnets. They did not talk much as they worked. As they finished their task, Patience looked up and said, ""I know! I will hide my kitten in my pocket. That way, she can come with me everywhere. Her name will be Midnight.""
Primrose looked at her sister and sighed. There was no point disagreeing with her. It was clear that Patience was determined to have a pet kitten. When they finished weeding, Primrose stood up and looked toward their cabin. ""We should go help Mama with the quilt. Now that it is spring, maybe she will make each of us a new dress,"" she said hopefully. Patience's eyes lit up. ""I want a blue dress with a very large pocket,"" she said excitedly.

For this reason, these colonies earned the name 'the breadbasket of the colonies'. They grew huge amounts of rye, barley, and wheat. Farmers sent their grain to water-powered mills across the region. At the mills, grain was turned into flour. The flour was sold to other colonies and to people in the West Indies. It was even sold to English merchants, who shipped it to England.
The Middle Atlantic colonies were known for more than farming. Along the coast, fishermen caught fish and skilled workers built boats and ships. Men cut down trees from forests and turned them into lumber for boats and to ship to England. Because people could worship freely, different churches appeared throughout the Middle Atlantic colonies. There were many Christian churches, including the Lutheran church the girls' family attended. Like the children's family, most Swedish settlers were Lutheran. There were Jewish temples too. Small, one-room schoolhouses were also appearing. Only boys could attend them.

Primrose and Patience went to do their chores. They led the cows into the pasture. The cows followed them obediently along the familiar path. After that, they weeded and watered the newly planted vegetable garden. They stopped only once to drink water from the well and to put on their sun bonnets. They did not talk much as they worked. As they finished their task, Patience looked up and said, ""I know! I will hide my kitten in my pocket. That way, she can come with me everywhere. Her name will be Midnight.""
Primrose looked at her sister and sighed. There was no point disagreeing with her. It was clear that Patience was determined to have a pet kitten.

The girls' uncle had given them good advice about the Middle Atlantic colonies. These colonies gave people from Europe new chances and religious freedom.

Papa often told the children stories about his trips to town. He described all the different languages people spoke there. He told them about people who came from many parts of Europe. He would occasionally bring home strange foods from the market or from a street vendor. One favorite was English 'pop robbins' - delicious balls made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Papa described the different clothes people wore and the different customs he heard about.
Most of their neighbors came from different parts of Europe. Their closest neighbor was a German family. In the early 1700s, German families had started coming to this colony. At harvest time, their German neighbors cooked scrapple and brought it to their home. The boys loved this dish made of meat and grain. The girls liked it less, but they loved the apple strudel that came after. The family had also visited an Irish family who lived about a mile away. Mama was amazed by how much the Irish family liked butter and cream.

        Do you remember Patience and Primrose from the last chapter? They found something special under a bush. When we left them, they were going to do their chores. Let's see what happened next.
The girls' uncle had given them good advice about the Middle Atlantic colonies. These colonies gave people from Europe new chances and religious freedom. Even though these were English colonies, people from Germany, Holland, France, Sweden, and Ireland came to live in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. Every day, more people arrived to start new lives.

Papa often told the children stories about his trips to town. He described all the different languages people spoke there. He told them about people who came from many parts of Europe. He would occasionally bring home strange foods from the market or from a street vendor. One favorite was English 'pop robbins' - delicious balls made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Papa described the different clothes people wore and the different customs he heard about.
Most of their neighbors came from different parts of Europe. Their closest neighbor was a German family. In the early 1700s, German families had started coming to this colony. At harvest time, their German neighbors cooked scrapple and brought it to their home. The boys loved this dish made of meat and grain. The girls liked it less, but they loved the apple strudel that came after. The family had also visited an Irish family who lived about a mile away. Mama was amazed by how much the Irish family liked butter and cream.

---

Everyone knew that the Middle Atlantic colonies grew more food than the New England colonies. The soil was much better for farming. For this reason, these colonies earned the name 'the breadbasket of the colonies'. They grew huge amounts of rye, barley, and wheat. Farmers sent their grain to water-powered mills across the region. At the mills, grain was turned into flour. The flour was sold to other colonies and to people in the West Indies. It was even sold to English merchants, who shipped it to England.
The Middle Atlantic colonies were known for more than farming. Along the coast, fishermen caught fish and skilled workers built boats and ships. Men cut down trees from forests and turned them into lumber for boats and to ship to England. Because people could worship freely, different churches appeared throughout the Middle Atlantic colonies. There were many Christian churches, including the Lutheran church the girls' family attended. Like the children's family, most Swedish settlers were Lutheran. There were Jewish temples too. Small, one-room schoolhouses were also appearing. Only boys could attend them.

Primrose and Patience went to do their chores. They led the cows into the pasture. The cows followed them obediently along the familiar path. After that, they weeded and watered the newly planted vegetable garden. They stopped only once to drink water from the well and to put on their sun bonnets. They did not talk much as they worked. As they finished their task, Patience looked up and said, ""I know! I will hide my kitten in my pocket. That way, she can come with me everywhere. Her name will be Midnight.""
Primrose looked at her sister and sighed. There was no point disagreeing with her. It was clear that Patience was determined to have a pet kitten. When they finished weeding, Primrose stood up and looked toward their cabin. ""We should go help Mama with the quilt. Now that it is spring, maybe she will make each of us a new dress,"" she said hopefully. Patience's eyes lit up. ""I want a blue dress with a very large pocket,"" she said excitedly.

        Charles, Hester, and their father, Micah, walked slowly toward the Lenni Lenape village. They were bringing gifts from families in their small Quaker colony. One year earlier, in 1685, young Lenni Lenape men had helped newly-arrived English and Welsh Quakers clear land for farming.
The gifts were packed in three heavy straw baskets. Charles and Hester struggled to carry theirs. The baskets held dumplings, cheese, bread, apple butter, and ham. Neither Charles nor Hester felt nervous about visiting the village. They had been there many times before with their father. They had even been inside the homes, called wigwams. Both children had been astonished by how warm and dry these bark homes were.

---

The village sat on the bank of a long, winding river. About thirty wigwams and four longhouses filled the area. Like wigwams, longhouses were made from wooden frames covered in bark. However, several families lived together in one longhouse. On the outskirts of the village, the children could see fields full of corn, squash, and beans. In the river near the bank, four dugout canoes bobbed up and down in the water. Two canoes held piles of raccoon, beaver, and fox fur. This fur showed that some Lenni Lenape men would soon trade with Europeans or other Native Americans.
Charles and Hester were Quakers from England. They had arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the previous year with their parents. Philadelphia was a growing town in the English colony of Pennsylvania. In 1681, William Penn, a Quaker leader, had received this land from King Charles II of England. The king gave him the land to settle a debt he owed to William's father.

---

William Penn was grateful because he wanted this land to be a safe place for Quakers. Quakers were persecuted in England. They were often arrested and some were killed because of their beliefs. Quakers were unpopular because they did not believe in war and refused to fight. They also believed that everyone in the world was equal, including Native Americans and African slaves. These views made the king's government very angry.
As the children neared the village, a Lenni Lenape boy ran toward them. ""Hello, Lapowinsa,"" said Charles. Both Charles and Hester had taught Lapowinsa to speak English. He was their friend. The village people smiled at the children's father and came to greet him. Charles always admired the breechcloths and leggings that the men wore. The women wore dresses with long, braided hair. Everyone wore moccasins on their feet.

---

Their father had learned some of the Lenni Lenape language. With William Penn, he had helped purchase the land they lived on from the Lenni Lenape. After giving the gifts, their father was invited to smoke tobacco with some men. This meant Charles, Hester, and Lapowinsa could play together.

        Charles, Hester, and their father, Micah, walked slowly toward the Lenni Lenape village. They were bringing gifts from families in their small Quaker colony. One year earlier, in 1685, young Lenni Lenape men had helped newly-arrived English and Welsh Quakers clear land for farming.
The gifts were packed in three heavy straw baskets. Charles and Hester struggled to carry theirs. The baskets held dumplings, cheese, bread, apple butter, and ham. Neither Charles nor Hester felt nervous about visiting the village. They had been there many times before with their father. They had even been inside the homes, called wigwams. Both children had been astonished by how warm and dry these bark homes were.

---

The village sat on the bank of a long, winding river. About thirty wigwams and four longhouses filled the area. Like wigwams, longhouses were made from wooden frames covered in bark. However, several families lived together in one longhouse. On the outskirts of the village, the children could see fields full of corn, squash, and beans. In the river near the bank, four dugout canoes bobbed up and down in the water. Two canoes held piles of raccoon, beaver, and fox fur. This fur showed that some Lenni Lenape men would soon trade with Europeans or other Native Americans.
Charles and Hester were Quakers from England. They had arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the previous year with their parents. Philadelphia was a growing town in the English colony of Pennsylvania. In 1681, William Penn, a Quaker leader, had received this land from King Charles II of England. The king gave him the land to settle a debt he owed to William's father.

---

William Penn was grateful because he wanted this land to be a safe place for Quakers. Quakers were persecuted in England. They were often arrested and some were killed because of their beliefs. Quakers were unpopular because they did not believe in war and refused to fight. They also believed that everyone in the world was equal, including Native Americans and African slaves. These views made the king's government very angry.
As the children neared the village, a Lenni Lenape boy ran toward them. ""Hello, Lapowinsa,"" said Charles. Both Charles and Hester had taught Lapowinsa to speak English. He was their friend. The village people smiled at the children's father and came to greet him. Charles always admired the breechcloths and leggings that the men wore. The women wore dresses with long, braided hair. Everyone wore moccasins on their feet.

Their father had learned some of the Lenni Lenape language. With William Penn, he had helped purchase the land they lived on from the Lenni Lenape. After giving the gifts, their father was invited to smoke tobacco with some men. This meant Charles, Hester, and Lapowinsa could play together. Lapowinsa had promised to take them out in a canoe to search for turtles. ""Be back before sunset,"" their father called.

The village sat on the bank of a long, winding river. About thirty wigwams and four longhouses filled the area. Like wigwams, longhouses were made from wooden frames covered in bark. However, several families lived together in one longhouse. On the outskirts of the village, the children could see fields full of corn, squash, and beans. In the river near the bank, four dugout canoes bobbed up and down in the water. Two canoes held piles of raccoon, beaver, and fox fur. This fur showed that some Lenni Lenape men would soon trade with Europeans or other Native Americans.
Charles and Hester were Quakers from England. They had arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the previous year with their parents. Philadelphia was a growing town in the English colony of Pennsylvania. In 1681, William Penn, a Quaker leader, had received this land from King Charles II of England. The king gave him the land to settle a debt he owed to William's father.

William Penn was grateful because he wanted this land to be a safe place for Quakers. Quakers were persecuted in England. They were often arrested and some were killed because of their beliefs. Quakers were unpopular because they did not believe in war and refused to fight. They also believed that everyone in the world was equal, including Native Americans and African slaves. These views made the king's government very angry.
As the children neared the village, a Lenni Lenape boy ran toward them. ""Hello, Lapowinsa,"" said Charles. Both Charles and Hester had taught Lapowinsa to speak English. He was their friend. The village people smiled at the children's father and came to greet him. Charles always admired the breechcloths and leggings that the men wore. The women wore dresses with long, braided hair. Everyone wore moccasins on their feet.

These views made the king's government very angry.
As the children neared the village, a Lenni Lenape boy ran toward them. ""Hello, Lapowinsa,"" said Charles. Both Charles and Hester had taught Lapowinsa to speak English. He was their friend. The village people smiled at the children's father and came to greet him. Charles always admired the breechcloths and leggings that the men wore. The women wore dresses with long, braided hair. Everyone wore moccasins on their feet.

Their father had learned some of the Lenni Lenape language. With William Penn, he had helped purchase the land they lived on from the Lenni Lenape. After giving the gifts, their father was invited to smoke tobacco with some men. This meant Charles, Hester, and Lapowinsa could play together.

        In 1755, a young boy named Matthew worked in Philadelphia. He was a printer's apprentice. This means he was learning how to print books and newspapers from his uncle. Matthew came from a small village thirty miles away from the big city.
Matthew's father was a craftsman called a cooper. A cooper makes wooden containers like barrels and buckets. He also made a special container called a cask. People in the colonies stored their food and drinks in these wooden containers. Matthew thought he would work with his father when he grew up. But his older brother Jonah became their father's helper instead.
When Matthew was eleven years old, his Uncle Abraham visited his family. Uncle Abraham gave Matthew an opportunity to come to Philadelphia. At first, Matthew did not want to leave his family. He loved his three younger sisters and his brother. But his parents explained that he needed to learn a skill to support a family when he grew up.

---

Matthew signed a special agreement with his uncle. He promised to faithfully serve his uncle and obey his commands. Uncle Abraham promised to teach Matthew printing skills for seven years. He would also give Matthew food, clothes, and a place to live. Four weeks later, Matthew's father took him to Philadelphia in their wagon.
Matthew spent two days exploring the big city with his father and uncle. On the third day, his father said goodbye. Matthew watched his father leave until he could not see him anymore. Matthew felt sad, but he did not cry.
Four years passed quickly. Now Matthew was fifteen years old. He had three more years to work as an apprentice. After that, he would become a journeyman. A journeyman was a skilled worker but not yet a master. Matthew hoped to become a master craftsman when he turned twenty-one. Then he could open his own printing business.

---

Matthew's hardest job was printing newspapers. It took more than twenty hours to print just one page! First, he had to arrange tiny metal pieces with letters on them. This was called setting the type. Then he spread ink over the letters. The printing press moved the words from the metal pieces onto paper.
Uncle Abraham asked Matthew to make a delivery. Matthew picked up printed sermons to take to Pastor Keller at the Lutheran church. Pastor Keller was the minister who led the church services. Matthew also needed to make more ink when he returned. Ink was made from several things. The ingredient list included tannin, iron sulfate, gum, and water. Matthew was happy to see that his uncle had all these supplies.

Matthew walked down the street toward the small wooden church. A small, shaggy brown dog came to walk with him. The dog had fuzzy, messy fur all over its body. This same dog had come to their kitchen door several times that week. Matthew had given it food scraps, so now the dog followed him around.
""Hey, you want to come with me?"" Matthew asked the dog. He clicked his fingers to call the dog. The small dog looked up at Matthew and wagged its tail happily. ""Okay then,"" said Matthew. ""Let's go."" Matthew began to run down the street. He held tight to his delivery of sermons.

        In 1755, a young boy named Matthew worked in Philadelphia. He was a printer's apprentice. This means he was learning how to print books and newspapers from his uncle. Matthew came from a small village thirty miles away from the big city.
Matthew's father was a craftsman called a cooper. A cooper makes wooden containers like barrels and buckets. He also made a special container called a cask. People in the colonies stored their food and drinks in these wooden containers. Matthew thought he would work with his father when he grew up. But his older brother Jonah became their father's helper instead.
When Matthew was eleven years old, his Uncle Abraham visited his family. Uncle Abraham gave Matthew an opportunity to come to Philadelphia. At first, Matthew did not want to leave his family. He loved his three younger sisters and his brother. But his parents explained that he needed to learn a skill to support a family when he grew up.

---

Matthew signed a special agreement with his uncle. He promised to faithfully serve his uncle and obey his commands. Uncle Abraham promised to teach Matthew printing skills for seven years. He would also give Matthew food, clothes, and a place to live. Four weeks later, Matthew's father took him to Philadelphia in their wagon.
Matthew spent two days exploring the big city with his father and uncle. On the third day, his father said goodbye. Matthew watched his father leave until he could not see him anymore. Matthew felt sad, but he did not cry.
Four years passed quickly. Now Matthew was fifteen years old. He had three more years to work as an apprentice. After that, he would become a journeyman. A journeyman was a skilled worker but not yet a master. Matthew hoped to become a master craftsman when he turned twenty-one. Then he could open his own printing business.

---

Matthew's hardest job was printing newspapers. It took more than twenty hours to print just one page! First, he had to arrange tiny metal pieces with letters on them. This was called setting the type. Then he spread ink over the letters. The printing press moved the words from the metal pieces onto paper.
Uncle Abraham asked Matthew to make a delivery. Matthew picked up printed sermons to take to Pastor Keller at the Lutheran church. Pastor Keller was the minister who led the church services. Matthew also needed to make more ink when he returned. Ink was made from several things. The ingredient list included tannin, iron sulfate, gum, and water. Matthew was happy to see that his uncle had all these supplies.

---

Matthew walked down the street toward the small wooden church. A small, shaggy brown dog came to walk with him. The dog had fuzzy, messy fur all over its body. This same dog had come to their kitchen door several times that week. Matthew had given it food scraps, so now the dog followed him around.
""Hey, you want to come with me?"" Matthew asked the dog. He clicked his fingers to call the dog. The small dog looked up at Matthew and wagged its tail happily. ""Okay then,"" said Matthew.

        In 1755, a young boy named Matthew worked in Philadelphia. He was a printer's apprentice. This means he was learning how to print books and newspapers from his uncle. Matthew came from a small village thirty miles away from the big city.
Matthew's father was a craftsman called a cooper. A cooper makes wooden containers like barrels and buckets. He also made a special container called a cask. People in the colonies stored their food and drinks in these wooden containers. Matthew thought he would work with his father when he grew up. But his older brother Jonah became their father's helper instead.
When Matthew was eleven years old, his Uncle Abraham visited his family. Uncle Abraham gave Matthew an opportunity to come to Philadelphia. At first, Matthew did not want to leave his family. He loved his three younger sisters and his brother. But his parents explained that he needed to learn a skill to support a family when he grew up.

---

Matthew signed a special agreement with his uncle. He promised to faithfully serve his uncle and obey his commands. Uncle Abraham promised to teach Matthew printing skills for seven years. He would also give Matthew food, clothes, and a place to live. Four weeks later, Matthew's father took him to Philadelphia in their wagon.
Matthew spent two days exploring the big city with his father and uncle. On the third day, his father said goodbye. Matthew watched his father leave until he could not see him anymore. Matthew felt sad, but he did not cry.
Four years passed quickly. Now Matthew was fifteen years old. He had three more years to work as an apprentice. After that, he would become a journeyman. A journeyman was a skilled worker but not yet a master. Matthew hoped to become a master craftsman when he turned twenty-one. Then he could open his own printing business.

---

Matthew's hardest job was printing newspapers. It took more than twenty hours to print just one page! First, he had to arrange tiny metal pieces with letters on them. This was called setting the type. Then he spread ink over the letters. The printing press moved the words from the metal pieces onto paper.
Uncle Abraham asked Matthew to make a delivery. Matthew picked up printed sermons to take to Pastor Keller at the Lutheran church. Pastor Keller was the minister who led the church services. Matthew also needed to make more ink when he returned. Ink was made from several things. The ingredient list included tannin, iron sulfate, gum, and water. Matthew was happy to see that his uncle had all these supplies.

---

Matthew walked down the street toward the small wooden church. A small, shaggy brown dog came to walk with him. The dog had fuzzy, messy fur all over its body. This same dog had come to their kitchen door several times that week. Matthew had given it food scraps, so now the dog followed him around.
""Hey, you want to come with me?"" Matthew asked the dog. He clicked his fingers to call the dog. The small dog looked up at Matthew and wagged its tail happily. ""Okay then,"" said Matthew.

        Ecology is the study of nature and life. It looks at how living things connect with their environment. Scientists who study ecology are called ecologists. They watch how animals and plants live together in nature.
For example, a toad lives in an ecosystem. An ecosystem is like a big neighborhood where many different living things make their homes. In an ecosystem, every living organism needs other living and non-living things to survive. Insects find food and shelter on trees and in soft moss. The toad catches those insects for dinner. The toad also needs rain to make puddles where it can lay its eggs. One day, a snake might eat the toad. This is how nature works, and ecologists love to study these connections!

---

Imagine a busy bee visiting a bright flower. The bee drinks the flower's sweet nectar, which gives it energy. The flower is also covered with pollen, a yellow powder that looks like tiny dust. When the bee flies away, some pollen sticks to its fuzzy body and legs.
Flowers need to share their pollen with other flowers to make seeds. Since flowers cannot walk or fly, they depend on bees and other insects to carry their pollen from place to place. The bee needs the flower's nectar to live. The flower needs the bee to spread its pollen. Both living things help each other survive. This partnership is exactly what ecologists study!

---

Now think about a forest squirrel that might surprise you if you saw her. She does not skitter around city parks like other squirrels you know. Instead, she lives deep in the woods where few people visit. High up in an oak tree, she has built a cozy nest from leaves and twigs.
In spring, baby squirrels lived in her nest. Now it is late summer, and the babies have grown up and left. The mother squirrel spends her days gathering acorns, which are nuts from oak trees. She knows that winter is coming, when food will be hard to find.
The clever squirrel digs small holes in the ground with her paws. She buries hundreds of acorns in different spots. During the cold winter months, she can dig up these hidden acorns when she gets hungry. This planning helps her survival through the harsh winter.

---

The squirrel clearly needs the oak tree for food and shelter. But how does she help the tree? The answer is simple: she forgets! The squirrel cannot remember where she buried every single acorn. Many acorns stay buried in the ground all winter long.
Acorns are actually seeds covered by hard shells. Like most seeds, they need to be planted in soil to grow into new oak trees. When the squirrel buries acorns and forgets about them, she is actually planting new trees! Without the squirrel's help, many acorns would just sit on top of the ground where other animals might eat them.
The squirrel and oak tree both do what they need to survive and have babies. The tree grows leaves for shelter and acorns for food. The squirrel uses both to live and raise her young. Because the squirrel plants acorns, the oak tree can grow new baby trees too. This is how an ecosystem works, and this is what ecology teaches us!",,,,,Which fact about the bee is clear from the description of the bee visiting the flower?,MCQ,The bee lives in a hive with other bees.,The bee makes honey from the nectar.,The bee flies to many different flowers each day.,The bee drinks the flower's sweet nectar.,D,Good try!

Flowers need to share their pollen with other flowers to make seeds. Since flowers cannot walk or fly, they depend on bees and other insects to carry their pollen from place to place. The bee needs the flower's nectar to live. The flower needs the bee to spread its pollen. Both living things help each other survive. This partnership is exactly what ecologists study!

Now think about a forest squirrel that might surprise you if you saw her. She does not skitter around city parks like other squirrels you know. Instead, she lives deep in the woods where few people visit. High up in an oak tree, she has built a cozy nest from leaves and twigs.
In spring, baby squirrels lived in her nest. Now it is late summer, and the babies have grown up and left. The mother squirrel spends her days gathering acorns, which are nuts from oak trees. She knows that winter is coming, when food will be hard to find.
The clever squirrel digs small holes in the ground with her paws. She buries hundreds of acorns in different spots. During the cold winter months, she can dig up these hidden acorns when she gets hungry. This planning helps her survival through the harsh winter.

The squirrel clearly needs the oak tree for food and shelter. But how does she help the tree? The answer is simple: she forgets! The squirrel cannot remember where she buried every single acorn. Many acorns stay buried in the ground all winter long.
Acorns are actually seeds covered by hard shells. Like most seeds, they need to be planted in soil to grow into new oak trees. When the squirrel buries acorns and forgets about them, she is actually planting new trees! Without the squirrel's help, many acorns would just sit on top of the ground where other animals might eat them.
The squirrel and oak tree both do what they need to survive and have babies. The tree grows leaves for shelter and acorns for food. The squirrel uses both to live and raise her young.

        Ecology is the study of nature and life. It looks at how living things connect with their environment. Scientists who study ecology are called ecologists. They watch how animals and plants live together in nature.
For example, a toad lives in an ecosystem. An ecosystem is like a big neighborhood where many different living things make their homes. In an ecosystem, every living organism needs other living and non-living things to survive. Insects find food and shelter on trees and in soft moss. The toad catches those insects for dinner. The toad also needs rain to make puddles where it can lay its eggs. One day, a snake might eat the toad. This is how nature works, and ecologists love to study these connections!

        Ecology is the study of nature and life. It looks at how living things connect with their environment. Scientists who study ecology are called ecologists. They watch how animals and plants live together in nature.
For example, a toad lives in an ecosystem. An ecosystem is like a big neighborhood where many different living things make their homes. In an ecosystem, every living organism needs other living and non-living things to survive. Insects find food and shelter on trees and in soft moss. The toad catches those insects for dinner. The toad also needs rain to make puddles where it can lay its eggs. One day, a snake might eat the toad. This is how nature works, and ecologists love to study these connections!

Imagine a busy bee visiting a bright flower. The bee drinks the flower's sweet nectar, which gives it energy. The flower is also covered with pollen, a yellow powder that looks like tiny dust. When the bee flies away, some pollen sticks to its fuzzy body and legs.
Flowers need to share their pollen with other flowers to make seeds. Since flowers cannot walk or fly, they depend on bees and other insects to carry their pollen from place to place. The bee needs the flower's nectar to live. The flower needs the bee to spread its pollen. Both living things help each other survive. This partnership is exactly what ecologists study!

Now think about a forest squirrel that might surprise you if you saw her. She does not skitter around city parks like other squirrels you know. Instead, she lives deep in the woods where few people visit. High up in an oak tree, she has built a cozy nest from leaves and twigs.
In spring, baby squirrels lived in her nest. Now it is late summer, and the babies have grown up and left. The mother squirrel spends her days gathering acorns, which are nuts from oak trees. She knows that winter is coming, when food will be hard to find.
The clever squirrel digs small holes in the ground with her paws. She buries hundreds of acorns in different spots. During the cold winter months, she can dig up these hidden acorns when she gets hungry. This planning helps her survival through the harsh winter.

The squirrel clearly needs the oak tree for food and shelter. But how does she help the tree? The answer is simple: she forgets! The squirrel cannot remember where she buried every single acorn. Many acorns stay buried in the ground all winter long.

When the squirrel buries acorns and forgets about them, she is actually planting new trees!

Flowers need to share their pollen with other flowers to make seeds. Since flowers cannot walk or fly, they depend on bees and other insects to carry their pollen from place to place. The bee needs the flower's nectar to live. The flower needs the bee to spread its pollen. Both living things help each other survive. This partnership is exactly what ecologists study!

Now think about a forest squirrel that might surprise you if you saw her. She does not skitter around city parks like other squirrels you know. Instead, she lives deep in the woods where few people visit. High up in an oak tree, she has built a cozy nest from leaves and twigs.
In spring, baby squirrels lived in her nest. Now it is late summer, and the babies have grown up and left. The mother squirrel spends her days gathering acorns, which are nuts from oak trees. She knows that winter is coming, when food will be hard to find.
The clever squirrel digs small holes in the ground with her paws. She buries hundreds of acorns in different spots. During the cold winter months, she can dig up these hidden acorns when she gets hungry. This planning helps her survival through the harsh winter.

The squirrel clearly needs the oak tree for food and shelter. But how does she help the tree? The answer is simple: she forgets! The squirrel cannot remember where she buried every single acorn. Many acorns stay buried in the ground all winter long.
Acorns are actually seeds covered by hard shells. Like most seeds, they need to be planted in soil to grow into new oak trees. When the squirrel buries acorns and forgets about them, she is actually planting new trees! Without the squirrel's help, many acorns would just sit on top of the ground where other animals might eat them.
The squirrel and oak tree both do what they need to survive and have babies. The tree grows leaves for shelter and acorns for food. The squirrel uses both to live and raise her young.

        Ecology is the study of nature and life. It looks at how living things connect with their environment. Scientists who study ecology are called ecologists. They watch how animals and plants live together in nature.
For example, a toad lives in an ecosystem. An ecosystem is like a big neighborhood where many different living things make their homes. In an ecosystem, every living organism needs other living and non-living things to survive. Insects find food and shelter on trees and in soft moss. The toad catches those insects for dinner. The toad also needs rain to make puddles where it can lay its eggs. One day, a snake might eat the toad. This is how nature works, and ecologists love to study these connections!

        Oak trees and squirrels help each other in many ways. Each year, oak trees make thousands of acorns. Only a few of these acorns will sprout and grow into young trees called saplings. Just a couple of those saplings will survive to become mighty oak trees with strong roots.
Most acorns become food for forest animals. Deer, turkeys, and woodpeckers eat many of them. The acorns that don't get eaten fall to the ground. Leaves cover them, rain soaks them, and snow freezes them. If worms and other creatures don't eat them first, some acorns will sprout in the soil and grow into new trees.

---

In the forest, all living things need each other. This is called an ecosystem. Trees give shelter and food to many animals. You can find bugs on almost every tree, and woodpeckers know how to find them too! If you dig in the soil or look under tree bark, you will discover worms, beetles, and ants. These small creatures live mostly underground, but they get important nutrients from the soil and dead leaves.
All living things must make babies to keep their species alive. Plants make seeds, while animals like squirrels and deer have live babies. Birds and bugs lay eggs. Spiders make special egg sacs that hold hundreds of tiny baby spiders. When the sac opens, most baby spiders will be eaten by other creatures. Only the strongest ones will survive to become hunters like their parents.

---

Animals must find ways to protect themselves from danger. Each animal has its own defense against enemies. Squirrels build nests high in trees to stay safe from predators. Worms dig deep into the soil to hide. Snails and turtles have hard shells as their defense. However, these ways to protect themselves don't always work.
Predators are animals that hunt and eat other animals for food. They have sharp teeth and claws to catch their prey. The animals that get caught and eaten are called prey. This creates what scientists call a food chain.

---

Every ecosystem has its own food chain. Think about a simple example: acorns feed deer, and wolves eat deer. But real food chains are much more complex. They include plants, bacteria, and tiny organisms you can't see. Plants and small animals are usually at the bottom of the food chain.

Most acorns become food for forest animals. Deer, turkeys, and woodpeckers eat many of them. The acorns that don't get eaten fall to the ground. Leaves cover them, rain soaks them, and snow freezes them. If worms and other creatures don't eat them first, some acorns will sprout in the soil and grow into new trees.

---

In the forest, all living things need each other. This is called an ecosystem. Trees give shelter and food to many animals. You can find bugs on almost every tree, and woodpeckers know how to find them too! If you dig in the soil or look under tree bark, you will discover worms, beetles, and ants. These small creatures live mostly underground, but they get important nutrients from the soil and dead leaves.
All living things must make babies to keep their species alive. Plants make seeds, while animals like squirrels and deer have live babies. Birds and bugs lay eggs. Spiders make special egg sacs that hold hundreds of tiny baby spiders. When the sac opens, most baby spiders will be eaten by other creatures. Only the strongest ones will survive to become hunters like their parents.

---

Animals must find ways to protect themselves from danger. Each animal has its own defense against enemies. Squirrels build nests high in trees to stay safe from predators. Worms dig deep into the soil to hide. Snails and turtles have hard shells as their defense. However, these ways to protect themselves don't always work.
Predators are animals that hunt and eat other animals for food. They have sharp teeth and claws to catch their prey. The animals that get caught and eaten are called prey. This creates what scientists call a food chain.

---

Every ecosystem has its own food chain. Think about a simple example: acorns feed deer, and wolves eat deer. But real food chains are much more complex. They include plants, bacteria, and tiny organisms you can't see. Plants and small animals are usually at the bottom of the food chain. At the top are mighty hunters like grizzly bears, lions, and great white sharks.

        Oak trees and squirrels help each other in many ways. Each year, oak trees make thousands of acorns. Only a few of these acorns will sprout and grow into young trees called saplings. Just a couple of those saplings will survive to become mighty oak trees with strong roots.
Most acorns become food for forest animals. Deer, turkeys, and woodpeckers eat many of them. The acorns that don't get eaten fall to the ground. Leaves cover them, rain soaks them, and snow freezes them. If worms and other creatures don't eat them first, some acorns will sprout in the soil and grow into new trees.

---

In the forest, all living things need each other. This is called an ecosystem. Trees give shelter and food to many animals. You can find bugs on almost every tree, and woodpeckers know how to find them too! If you dig in the soil or look under tree bark, you will discover worms, beetles, and ants. These small creatures live mostly underground, but they get important nutrients from the soil and dead leaves.
All living things must make babies to keep their species alive. Plants make seeds, while animals like squirrels and deer have live babies. Birds and bugs lay eggs. Spiders make special egg sacs that hold hundreds of tiny baby spiders. When the sac opens, most baby spiders will be eaten by other creatures. Only the strongest ones will survive to become hunters like their parents.

---

Animals must find ways to protect themselves from danger. Each animal has its own defense against enemies. Squirrels build nests high in trees to stay safe from predators. Worms dig deep into the soil to hide. Snails and turtles have hard shells as their defense. However, these ways to protect themselves don't always work.
Predators are animals that hunt and eat other animals for food. They have sharp teeth and claws to catch their prey. The animals that get caught and eaten are called prey. This creates what scientists call a food chain.

Every ecosystem has its own food chain. Think about a simple example: acorns feed deer, and wolves eat deer. But real food chains are much more complex.

        Do you see the brown material in this picture? Some people call it dirt. Dirt is what you wipe off your shoes and wash off your hands. You should never get dirt on your good clothes! Some people think dirt is yucky and needs to be cleaned up. But scientists called ecologists know that dirt is very important. Ecologists call it soil instead of dirt. Without soil, life on land could not exist. Soil is at the heart of most ecosystems on land.
In forest ecosystems, every living thing fits into one of three groups: producers, consumers, and decomposers. Producers make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to make food from air and water. Many producers also make things that animals eat. The blackberry plant is a good example. It makes its own food through photosynthesis. The berries contain the plant's seeds. Wild animals like birds, bears, and bugs eat the berries. The animals eat the juicy berries, but they do not digest the tiny seeds.

---

Consumers eat other plants and animals. Squirrels are acorn consumers. But squirrels are not at the top of the food chain. Owls are skilled predators that hunt squirrels. Owls are nocturnal, which means they hunt at night. They have excellent hearing and eyesight. Any squirrel that leaves the safety of its nest at night might become the owl's dinner.
Decomposers are the third type of living thing in forest ecosystems. Earthworms are decomposers. They feed on dead organic matter, like fallen leaves. The worms pull the leaves down into the ground. They shred the leaves into tiny pieces and then eat them. Worms are low on the food chain. Fish, birds, frogs, and turtles will all eat any worm that crosses their paths.

---

Insects come in many sizes. Some are big, and some are so small you need a magnifying glass to see them. Some fly and some crawl. Some insects are decomposers. Others are consumers, and some are predators. Most insects are low on the food chain.
There are billions of other living things in the soil around the worm. These bacteria, fungus, and other organisms work to survive in the same soil. These organisms are microscopic, which means they are so small you cannot see them without a microscope. Bacteria are the most important decomposers. They are also the most common form of life in an ecosystem.

---

Bacteria and other tiny organisms cause dead plant and animal matter to decompose. When something begins to decompose, its body breaks down into simpler types of matter. As leaves decompose, their nutrients become part of the soil. The decomposed matter provides vitamins and minerals for new plants and other living things. This is how the forest ecosystem stays healthy and continues to grow.",,,,,The author of this passage would most likely agree that,MCQ,Decomposers are the least important organisms.,Soil is essential for life on land to exist.,Only scientists should study ecosystems.,Dirt should always be cleaned up immediately.,B,"Good try!

In forest ecosystems, every living thing fits into one of three groups: producers, consumers, and decomposers. Producers make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to make food from air and water. Many producers also make things that animals eat. The blackberry plant is a good example. It makes its own food through photosynthesis. The berries contain the plant's seeds. Wild animals like birds, bears, and bugs eat the berries. The animals eat the juicy berries, but they do not digest the tiny seeds.

Consumers eat other plants and animals. Squirrels are acorn consumers. But squirrels are not at the top of the food chain. Owls are skilled predators that hunt squirrels. Owls are nocturnal, which means they hunt at night. They have excellent hearing and eyesight. Any squirrel that leaves the safety of its nest at night might become the owl's dinner.
Decomposers are the third type of living thing in forest ecosystems. Earthworms are decomposers. They feed on dead organic matter, like fallen leaves. The worms pull the leaves down into the ground. They shred the leaves into tiny pieces and then eat them. Worms are low on the food chain. Fish, birds, frogs, and turtles will all eat any worm that crosses their paths.

Insects come in many sizes. Some are big, and some are so small you need a magnifying glass to see them. Some fly and some crawl. Some insects are decomposers. Others are consumers, and some are predators. Most insects are low on the food chain.

During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to make food from air and water. Many producers also make things that animals eat. The blackberry plant is a good example. It makes its own food through photosynthesis. The berries contain the plant's seeds. Wild animals like birds, bears, and bugs eat the berries. The animals eat the juicy berries, but they do not digest the tiny seeds.

Consumers eat other plants and animals. Squirrels are acorn consumers. But squirrels are not at the top of the food chain. Owls are skilled predators that hunt squirrels. Owls are nocturnal, which means they hunt at night. They have excellent hearing and eyesight. Any squirrel that leaves the safety of its nest at night might become the owl's dinner.
Decomposers are the third type of living thing in forest ecosystems. Earthworms are decomposers. They feed on dead organic matter, like fallen leaves. The worms pull the leaves down into the ground. They shred the leaves into tiny pieces and then eat them. Worms are low on the food chain. Fish, birds, frogs, and turtles will all eat any worm that crosses their paths.

Insects come in many sizes. Some are big, and some are so small you need a magnifying glass to see them. Some fly and some crawl. Some insects are decomposers. Others are consumers, and some are predators. Most insects are low on the food chain.
There are billions of other living things in the soil around the worm. These bacteria, fungus, and other organisms work to survive in the same soil. These organisms are microscopic, which means they are so small you cannot see them without a microscope. Bacteria are the most important decomposers. They are also the most common form of life in an ecosystem.

---

Bacteria and other tiny organisms cause dead plant and animal matter to decompose. When something begins to decompose, its body breaks down into simpler types of matter.

        Do you see the brown material in this picture? Some people call it dirt. Dirt is what you wipe off your shoes and wash off your hands. You should never get dirt on your good clothes! Some people think dirt is yucky and needs to be cleaned up. But scientists called ecologists know that dirt is very important. Ecologists call it soil instead of dirt. Without soil, life on land could not exist. Soil is at the heart of most ecosystems on land.
In forest ecosystems, every living thing fits into one of three groups: producers, consumers, and decomposers. Producers make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to make food from air and water. Many producers also make things that animals eat. The blackberry plant is a good example. It makes its own food through photosynthesis. The berries contain the plant's seeds. Wild animals like birds, bears, and bugs eat the berries. The animals eat the juicy berries, but they do not digest the tiny seeds.

        This photo was taken in Kenya, a country in east Africa. Kenya is famous for the wildlife on its grasslands. When people visit Kenya, they often go on safari to see the animals. A large part of Kenya is part of the Mara National Reserve. A reserve is a protected area of land. People are not allowed to build towns or major roads there. The land is set aside for nature, especially the animals.
Most of the Mara is open grassland, known as a savanna. The land is mostly flat, with gently rolling hills. There are some trees and bushes growing in the savanna, but it is mostly grass. In many ways, the savanna ecosystem is like any other ecosystem. There are food chains with producers, consumers, and decomposers.

---

Huge herds of wildebeests, zebras, and other consumers eat the savanna grass. There is plenty of grass for everyone. This also means there is plenty of meat for the lions! The Mara is known for its many types of acacia trees. Giraffes like to eat acacia leaves. These leaves give giraffes important nutrients like vitamins and minerals that help them stay healthy and strong.
Some ants in the Mara like to eat certain acacia seeds. The ants carry the seeds underground. They eat the fruit that surrounds the seed, but they do not hurt the seed itself. Instead, they leave it there in the ground where they ate it. That's how some acacias spread their seeds! This is another example of a way in which organisms rely on each other in an ecosystem.

Each living thing in a healthy ecosystem can survive with help from other living things. The living things depend on each other. Of course, not all living things survive for very long. Many animals are eaten by bigger animals. Most seeds do not grow. But enough will survive to make sure life continues in the ecosystem.
The savanna's grass eaters would probably be happy if all the big cats disappeared. However, if all the big cats disappeared from the Mara, this would upset the natural balance in the food chain. Cheetahs and other predators hunt the weak, sick, and young members of the herd. As a result, the strong animals in the herd tend to survive and have healthy young.

No gazelle wants to be eaten by a lion or cheetah. But in an ecosystem, the predators help keep the population from getting out of control. If there were too many gazelles, then all gazelles might have trouble finding enough food. Cheetahs help make sure there aren't too many gazelles!
The grasslands of the Mara National Reserve seem to stretch on forever. It is hard to imagine anything bad ever happening to upset the ecosystem of this vast, beautiful land. But if nothing bad ever happened, then the government of Kenya would not have bothered making this a reserve. Many animals were illegally hunted to near extinction.

        This photo was taken in Kenya, a country in east Africa. Kenya is famous for the wildlife on its grasslands. When people visit Kenya, they often go on safari to see the animals. A large part of Kenya is part of the Mara National Reserve. A reserve is a protected area of land. People are not allowed to build towns or major roads there. The land is set aside for nature, especially the animals.
Most of the Mara is open grassland, known as a savanna. The land is mostly flat, with gently rolling hills. There are some trees and bushes growing in the savanna, but it is mostly grass. In many ways, the savanna ecosystem is like any other ecosystem. There are food chains with producers, consumers, and decomposers.

---

Huge herds of wildebeests, zebras, and other consumers eat the savanna grass. There is plenty of grass for everyone. This also means there is plenty of meat for the lions! The Mara is known for its many types of acacia trees. Giraffes like to eat acacia leaves. These leaves give giraffes important nutrients like vitamins and minerals that help them stay healthy and strong.
Some ants in the Mara like to eat certain acacia seeds. The ants carry the seeds underground. They eat the fruit that surrounds the seed, but they do not hurt the seed itself. Instead, they leave it there in the ground where they ate it. That's how some acacias spread their seeds! This is another example of a way in which organisms rely on each other in an ecosystem.

Each living thing in a healthy ecosystem can survive with help from other living things. The living things depend on each other. Of course, not all living things survive for very long. Many animals are eaten by bigger animals. Most seeds do not grow. But enough will survive to make sure life continues in the ecosystem.
The savanna's grass eaters would probably be happy if all the big cats disappeared. However, if all the big cats disappeared from the Mara, this would upset the natural balance in the food chain. Cheetahs and other predators hunt the weak, sick, and young members of the herd. As a result, the strong animals in the herd tend to survive and have healthy young.

No gazelle wants to be eaten by a lion or cheetah. But in an ecosystem, the predators help keep the population from getting out of control. If there were too many gazelles, then all gazelles might have trouble finding enough food. Cheetahs help make sure there aren't too many gazelles!
The grasslands of the Mara National Reserve seem to stretch on forever. It is hard to imagine anything bad ever happening to upset the ecosystem of this vast, beautiful land.

        This photo was taken in Kenya, a country in east Africa. Kenya is famous for the wildlife on its grasslands. When people visit Kenya, they often go on safari to see the animals. A large part of Kenya is part of the Mara National Reserve. A reserve is a protected area of land. People are not allowed to build towns or major roads there. The land is set aside for nature, especially the animals.
Most of the Mara is open grassland, known as a savanna. The land is mostly flat, with gently rolling hills. There are some trees and bushes growing in the savanna, but it is mostly grass. In many ways, the savanna ecosystem is like any other ecosystem. There are food chains with producers, consumers, and decomposers.

Huge herds of wildebeests, zebras, and other consumers eat the savanna grass. There is plenty of grass for everyone. This also means there is plenty of meat for the lions! The Mara is known for its many types of acacia trees. Giraffes like to eat acacia leaves. These leaves give giraffes important nutrients like vitamins and minerals that help them stay healthy and strong.
Some ants in the Mara like to eat certain acacia seeds. The ants carry the seeds underground. They eat the fruit that surrounds the seed, but they do not hurt the seed itself. Instead, they leave it there in the ground where they ate it. That's how some acacias spread their seeds! This is another example of a way in which organisms rely on each other in an ecosystem.

        Ecosystems can be fragile. It doesn't take much to cause big changes in the environment. Sometimes the ecosystem can recover from a change. Sometimes the change lasts forever.
One common force of nature is when land wears away. Over time, the land on both sides of a stream can erode. When it rains really hard, a little stream can fill with water and flood. A flood may last for an hour. It may last for a few days.
Plants on a hillside have roots that reach deep into the soil. The roots hold the soil together. When it rains, or when the wind blows really hard, the plant roots hold the soil in place. Without plants, the soil starts to erode.

Water is one of nature's most powerful forces. During a big flood, the entire landscape can be changed. A flooded river can tear apart plants, trees, and soil. First, the topsoil is removed. This is the richest soil, where you find most of the nutrients and matter that is starting to decay. Once the topsoil is washed away, the forces of nature slowly eat away at the clay and rock underneath.
There is a place called Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Throughout the park, there are ancient trees that have turned to stone. The trees have been petrified! These may look like normal rocks, but they're not! There was a forest ecosystem here about 200 million years ago. This was during prehistoric times, when some of the first dinosaurs walked on Earth. These rocks are actually pieces of very old trees!

Back then, there were plants, animals, and tiny living things that helped matter decay. Scientists have found fossils in the Petrified Forest. These show that there were swamp plants, like ferns. There were also dinosaurs that looked sort of like crocodiles.
At some point, the area was flooded by huge amounts of water and mud. The trees were covered completely. The entire forest was destroyed, along with the food chain. All that mud covering the trees dried up. Over millions of years, the mud turned to rock. Instead of rotting away, the trees turned to rock, too!

Plants on a hillside have roots that reach deep into the soil. The roots hold the soil together. When it rains, or when the wind blows really hard, the plant roots hold the soil in place. Without plants, the soil starts to erode.

Water is one of nature's most powerful forces. During a big flood, the entire landscape can be changed. A flooded river can tear apart plants, trees, and soil. First, the topsoil is removed. This is the richest soil, where you find most of the nutrients and matter that is starting to decay. Once the topsoil is washed away, the forces of nature slowly eat away at the clay and rock underneath.
There is a place called Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Throughout the park, there are ancient trees that have turned to stone. The trees have been petrified! These may look like normal rocks, but they're not! There was a forest ecosystem here about 200 million years ago. This was during prehistoric times, when some of the first dinosaurs walked on Earth. These rocks are actually pieces of very old trees!

---

Back then, there were plants, animals, and tiny living things that helped matter decay. Scientists have found fossils in the Petrified Forest. These show that there were swamp plants, like ferns. There were also dinosaurs that looked sort of like crocodiles.
At some point, the area was flooded by huge amounts of water and mud. The trees were covered completely. The entire forest was destroyed, along with the food chain. All that mud covering the trees dried up. Over millions of years, the mud turned to rock. Instead of rotting away, the trees turned to rock, too!

Millions of years and countless floods later, the land in Petrified Forest National Park has worn away. We are left with this strange landscape.

One common force of nature is when land wears away. Over time, the land on both sides of a stream can erode. When it rains really hard, a little stream can fill with water and flood. A flood may last for an hour. It may last for a few days.
Plants on a hillside have roots that reach deep into the soil. The roots hold the soil together. When it rains, or when the wind blows really hard, the plant roots hold the soil in place. Without plants, the soil starts to erode.

Water is one of nature's most powerful forces. During a big flood, the entire landscape can be changed. A flooded river can tear apart plants, trees, and soil. First, the topsoil is removed. This is the richest soil, where you find most of the nutrients and matter that is starting to decay. Once the topsoil is washed away, the forces of nature slowly eat away at the clay and rock underneath.
There is a place called Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Throughout the park, there are ancient trees that have turned to stone. The trees have been petrified! These may look like normal rocks, but they're not! There was a forest ecosystem here about 200 million years ago. This was during prehistoric times, when some of the first dinosaurs walked on Earth. These rocks are actually pieces of very old trees!

---

Back then, there were plants, animals, and tiny living things that helped matter decay. Scientists have found fossils in the Petrified Forest. These show that there were swamp plants, like ferns. There were also dinosaurs that looked sort of like crocodiles.
At some point, the area was flooded by huge amounts of water and mud. The trees were covered completely. The entire forest was destroyed, along with the food chain. All that mud covering the trees dried up. Over millions of years, the mud turned to rock. Instead of rotting away, the trees turned to rock, too!

---

Millions of years and countless floods later, the land in Petrified Forest National Park has worn away. We are left with this strange landscape. It is still called a forest, but many of the trees are really rocks. The land is almost like a desert now. However, the Petrified Forest does get some rain. There is actually a lot happening in this ecosystem, even though it looks like a dry, sandy place.
There are 500 different types of plants in Petrified Forest National Park. There are no dinosaurs, but there are little lizards. There are also toads, snakes, birds, and jackrabbits. Coyotes are near the top of the food chain. They eat just about anything, meat and plants alike. The Petrified Forest shows how nature's forces can change the landscape.

        Every plant and animal in nature needs other living things to survive. A butterfly needs flowers for food. At the same time, flowers need butterflies to spread their pollen from plant to plant.
Long ago, early humans were part of nature too. They hunted animals and gathered plants for food. They made homes and clothes from things they found around them. Most importantly, they only used what they needed to stay alive.
But humans were different from other animals. They could make and use technology. At first, they made simple tools from stone and wood. These tools helped them hunt better and build stronger shelters.

---

Over time, technology got much better. Humans learned to make machines. Instead of hunting wild animals, they learned to raise cows and chickens for food. Instead of gathering berries and nuts, they learned to grow their own crops. Humans learned to change and control parts of nature to meet their needs.
With technology, humans could change the environment in countless ways. A wheat field may have once been a forest or grassland. Insects and other living things still live in the soil and eat the wheat plants. But this is not a natural field anymore. Humans planted the seeds and decide when to harvest the crops.
Every town and city was once a natural place where many species of plants and animals lived. Then humans used technology to change these natural places. There are still some trees and flowers in cities, but only because people put them there. Some animals like squirrels and birds learned to live in cities with humans.

---

Today, with all our cities and technology, we sometimes forget about nature. We think of nature as something we can visit, not something we are part of. We think of nature as a resource we can use and change however we want.
The Hoover Dam shows how people can change nature. This huge dam was built across the Colorado River. The dam can generate hydroelectric power, or electricity, for over a million people. The reservoir created by the dam gives water to thousands of homes and farms. The river is the source of this water and power.
The Hoover Dam helps people, but it also changed the river forever. It changed how the river flows and put several species of fish and plants in danger. Some of these species became endangered, which means they might disappear completely. The dam was good for people but not good for the environment.

---

Not all changes that humans make are bad for nature. People can live good lives while still protecting the balance of nature. A small town surrounded by forests shows this. People have their houses and roads, but most of the land around them still belongs to nature. Even a jackrabbit can find safe places to live near the town.
People use nature primarily to meet their needs, but we can learn to do this without hurting the environment. We can protect the countless species that share our world while still using natural resources wisely.",,,,,"Based on Section 3, what happened to the Colorado River after the Hoover Dam was built?",MCQ,Its flow was changed.,It moved to a new location.,It dried up completely.,It became much cleaner.,A,"Great job!

The Hoover Dam shows how people can change nature. This huge dam was built across the Colorado River. The dam can generate hydroelectric power, or electricity, for over a million people. The reservoir created by the dam gives water to thousands of homes and farms. The river is the source of this water and power.
The Hoover Dam helps people, but it also changed the river forever. It changed how the river flows and put several species of fish and plants in danger. Some of these species became endangered, which means they might disappear completely. The dam was good for people but not good for the environment.

Long ago, early humans were part of nature too. They hunted animals and gathered plants for food. They made homes and clothes from things they found around them. Most importantly, they only used what they needed to stay alive.
But humans were different from other animals. They could make and use technology. At first, they made simple tools from stone and wood. These tools helped them hunt better and build stronger shelters.

---

Over time, technology got much better. Humans learned to make machines. Instead of hunting wild animals, they learned to raise cows and chickens for food. Instead of gathering berries and nuts, they learned to grow their own crops. Humans learned to change and control parts of nature to meet their needs.
With technology, humans could change the environment in countless ways. A wheat field may have once been a forest or grassland. Insects and other living things still live in the soil and eat the wheat plants. But this is not a natural field anymore. Humans planted the seeds and decide when to harvest the crops.
Every town and city was once a natural place where many species of plants and animals lived. Then humans used technology to change these natural places. There are still some trees and flowers in cities, but only because people put them there. Some animals like squirrels and birds learned to live in cities with humans.

Today, with all our cities and technology, we sometimes forget about nature. We think of nature as something we can visit, not something we are part of. We think of nature as a resource we can use and change however we want.
The Hoover Dam shows how people can change nature. This huge dam was built across the Colorado River. The dam can generate hydroelectric power, or electricity, for over a million people. The reservoir created by the dam gives water to thousands of homes and farms. The river is the source of this water and power.
The Hoover Dam helps people, but it also changed the river forever. It changed how the river flows and put several species of fish and plants in danger. Some of these species became endangered, which means they might disappear completely. The dam was good for people but not good for the environment.

---

Not all changes that humans make are bad for nature. People can live good lives while still protecting the balance of nature. A small town surrounded by forests shows this. People have their houses and roads, but most of the land around them still belongs to nature. Even a jackrabbit can find safe places to live near the town.

Long ago, early humans were part of nature too. They hunted animals and gathered plants for food. They made homes and clothes from things they found around them. Most importantly, they only used what they needed to stay alive.
But humans were different from other animals. They could make and use technology. At first, they made simple tools from stone and wood. These tools helped them hunt better and build stronger shelters.

---

Over time, technology got much better. Humans learned to make machines. Instead of hunting wild animals, they learned to raise cows and chickens for food. Instead of gathering berries and nuts, they learned to grow their own crops. Humans learned to change and control parts of nature to meet their needs.
With technology, humans could change the environment in countless ways. A wheat field may have once been a forest or grassland. Insects and other living things still live in the soil and eat the wheat plants. But this is not a natural field anymore. Humans planted the seeds and decide when to harvest the crops.
Every town and city was once a natural place where many species of plants and animals lived. Then humans used technology to change these natural places. There are still some trees and flowers in cities, but only because people put them there. Some animals like squirrels and birds learned to live in cities with humans.

---

Today, with all our cities and technology, we sometimes forget about nature. We think of nature as something we can visit, not something we are part of. We think of nature as a resource we can use and change however we want.
The Hoover Dam shows how people can change nature. This huge dam was built across the Colorado River. The dam can generate hydroelectric power, or electricity, for over a million people. The reservoir created by the dam gives water to thousands of homes and farms. The river is the source of this water and power.
The Hoover Dam helps people, but it also changed the river forever. It changed how the river flows and put several species of fish and plants in danger. Some of these species became endangered, which means they might disappear completely. The dam was good for people but not good for the environment.

---

Not all changes that humans make are bad for nature. People can live good lives while still protecting the balance of nature. A small town surrounded by forests shows this. People have their houses and roads, but most of the land around them still belongs to nature. Even a jackrabbit can find safe places to live near the town.

        Most vehicles you see every day need gasoline to work. Cars, boats, trains, and planes all use gasoline for energy. When a car's engine burns gasoline, it makes the car move. Gasoline comes from oil, which is a thick, black liquid found deep underground in certain places on Earth.
Getting oil out of the ground is very hard work. People drill deep wells into the earth. These wells pump oil up from underground. Thousands of oil wells around the world are used to get oil from deep in the ground.
Much oil is located deep beneath ocean waters. Workers use a special platform called an oil rig. The oil rig floats far out in the ocean. Dozens of workers live on the oil rig for months at a time. They use special drills to get oil from hundreds or thousands of feet beneath the ocean surface.

---

Unfortunately, drilling for oil is difficult and dangerous. This danger became real on April 20, 2010, when a terrible accident happened. An oil rig called the Deepwater Horizon was working in the Gulf of Mexico, about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana. An important piece of equipment deep underwater broke. This allowed oil and natural gases to escape from the earth. The escaping gases caused a huge explosion on the oil rig.
The Deepwater Horizon was destroyed by the explosion and fire. Sadly, 11 men died in the explosion and 16 others were badly hurt. But this was not the end of the story. The disaster that followed was a massive oil spill.
When the rig exploded, oil began flowing freely from inside the earth. Because it was so far underwater, nobody knew how to stop the oil. Within days, the waters near the damaged well were heavily polluted with thick, black oil. Oil continued to spill into the water for three months, and the oil quickly spread across the ocean.

---

The ocean ecosystem is fragile. Everything from tiny organisms to plants and fish need clean water to survive. The oil threatened fish and all other life in the nearby waters. Within days, oil from the oil spill washed up all along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The oil reached beaches in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The oil threatened the lives of fish, birds, and other wildlife in or near the water.
The grassy, shallow wetlands along the Gulf Coast are home to a fragile ecosystem with a huge variety of wildlife. People were especially worried about the effect oil might have on this area. In the wetlands, you can find shellfish like oysters, crabs, and shrimp. Many birds live there, including herons, pelicans, and egrets. Reptiles such as alligators and snakes also live in the Gulf Coast wetlands. All of these animals can be harmed if they get covered in oil or eat other animals covered in oil.

---

The wetlands are very important for people too. They provide seafood like the shrimp you might eat in a restaurant. The wetlands are important for other reasons as well. The grass roots keep sand and soil in place. If the grasses get covered in oil, they could die. Then the sand and soil would wash away. As a result, the coastline could erode, which would harm nearby towns and cities.
Oil from the oil spill was a threat to life at sea and on land, including people. This was a huge problem, and everyone knew something had to be done to protect the wetlands and wildlife from the oil. People worked hard to save the Gulf Coast from this terrible disaster.",,,,,Read the excerpt from Section 2. 'The escaping gases caused a huge explosion on the oil rig.' The phrase escaping gases caused shows that the gases were,MCQ,expected.,contained.,helpful.,dangerous.,D,"Good try! The story says it was an ""accident"" and ""Unfortunately,"" which means it wasn't expected. The gases were dangerous because they caused an explosion.","Not quite! If the gases were contained, they wouldn't escape and cause an explosion. The story shows the gases were dangerous when they got out.","Nice thinking, but the gases weren't helpful here.

The Deepwater Horizon was destroyed by the explosion and fire. Sadly, 11 men died in the explosion and 16 others were badly hurt. But this was not the end of the story. The disaster that followed was a massive oil spill.
When the rig exploded, oil began flowing freely from inside the earth. Because it was so far underwater, nobody knew how to stop the oil. Within days, the waters near the damaged well were heavily polluted with thick, black oil. Oil continued to spill into the water for three months, and the oil quickly spread across the ocean.

The ocean ecosystem is fragile. Everything from tiny organisms to plants and fish need clean water to survive. The oil threatened fish and all other life in the nearby waters. Within days, oil from the oil spill washed up all along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The oil reached beaches in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The oil threatened the lives of fish, birds, and other wildlife in or near the water.
The grassy, shallow wetlands along the Gulf Coast are home to a fragile ecosystem with a huge variety of wildlife. People were especially worried about the effect oil might have on this area. In the wetlands, you can find shellfish like oysters, crabs, and shrimp. Many birds live there, including herons, pelicans, and egrets. Reptiles such as alligators and snakes also live in the Gulf Coast wetlands. All of these animals can be harmed if they get covered in oil or eat other animals covered in oil.

---

The wetlands are very important for people too. They provide seafood like the shrimp you might eat in a restaurant. The wetlands are important for other reasons as well. The grass roots keep sand and soil in place. If the grasses get covered in oil, they could die. Then the sand and soil would wash away. As a result, the coastline could erode, which would harm nearby towns and cities.

        Most vehicles you see every day need gasoline to work. Cars, boats, trains, and planes all use gasoline for energy. When a car's engine burns gasoline, it makes the car move. Gasoline comes from oil, which is a thick, black liquid found deep underground in certain places on Earth.
Getting oil out of the ground is very hard work. People drill deep wells into the earth. These wells pump oil up from underground. Thousands of oil wells around the world are used to get oil from deep in the ground.
Much oil is located deep beneath ocean waters. Workers use a special platform called an oil rig. The oil rig floats far out in the ocean. Dozens of workers live on the oil rig for months at a time. They use special drills to get oil from hundreds or thousands of feet beneath the ocean surface.

Within days, the waters near the damaged well were heavily polluted with thick, black oil. Oil continued to spill into the water for three months, and the oil quickly spread across the ocean.

The ocean ecosystem is fragile. Everything from tiny organisms to plants and fish need clean water to survive. The oil threatened fish and all other life in the nearby waters. Within days, oil from the oil spill washed up all along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The oil reached beaches in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The oil threatened the lives of fish, birds, and other wildlife in or near the water.
The grassy, shallow wetlands along the Gulf Coast are home to a fragile ecosystem with a huge variety of wildlife. People were especially worried about the effect oil might have on this area. In the wetlands, you can find shellfish like oysters, crabs, and shrimp. Many birds live there, including herons, pelicans, and egrets. Reptiles such as alligators and snakes also live in the Gulf Coast wetlands. All of these animals can be harmed if they get covered in oil or eat other animals covered in oil.

The wetlands are very important for people too. They provide seafood like the shrimp you might eat in a restaurant. The wetlands are important for other reasons as well. The grass roots keep sand and soil in place. If the grasses get covered in oil, they could die. Then the sand and soil would wash away. As a result, the coastline could erode, which would harm nearby towns and cities.

        Most vehicles you see every day need gasoline to work. Cars, boats, trains, and planes all use gasoline for energy. When a car's engine burns gasoline, it makes the car move. Gasoline comes from oil, which is a thick, black liquid found deep underground in certain places on Earth.
Getting oil out of the ground is very hard work. People drill deep wells into the earth. These wells pump oil up from underground. Thousands of oil wells around the world are used to get oil from deep in the ground.
Much oil is located deep beneath ocean waters. Workers use a special platform called an oil rig. The oil rig floats far out in the ocean. Dozens of workers live on the oil rig for months at a time. They use special drills to get oil from hundreds or thousands of feet beneath the ocean surface.

The Deepwater Horizon was destroyed by the explosion and fire. Sadly, 11 men died in the explosion and 16 others were badly hurt. But this was not the end of the story. The disaster that followed was a massive oil spill.
When the rig exploded, oil began flowing freely from inside the earth. Because it was so far underwater, nobody knew how to stop the oil. Within days, the waters near the damaged well were heavily polluted with thick, black oil. Oil continued to spill into the water for three months, and the oil quickly spread across the ocean.

The ocean ecosystem is fragile. Everything from tiny organisms to plants and fish need clean water to survive. The oil threatened fish and all other life in the nearby waters. Within days, oil from the oil spill washed up all along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The oil reached beaches in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The oil threatened the lives of fish, birds, and other wildlife in or near the water.
The grassy, shallow wetlands along the Gulf Coast are home to a fragile ecosystem with a huge variety of wildlife. People were especially worried about the effect oil might have on this area. In the wetlands, you can find shellfish like oysters, crabs, and shrimp. Many birds live there, including herons, pelicans, and egrets. Reptiles such as alligators and snakes also live in the Gulf Coast wetlands. All of these animals can be harmed if they get covered in oil or eat other animals covered in oil.

The wetlands are very important for people too. They provide seafood like the shrimp you might eat in a restaurant. The wetlands are important for other reasons as well. The grass roots keep sand and soil in place. If the grasses get covered in oil, they could die. Then the sand and soil would wash away. As a result, the coastline could erode, which would harm nearby towns and cities.

        Most vehicles you see every day need gasoline to work. Cars, boats, trains, and planes all use gasoline for energy. When a car's engine burns gasoline, it makes the car move. Gasoline comes from oil, which is a thick, black liquid found deep underground in certain places on Earth.
Getting oil out of the ground is very hard work. People drill deep wells into the earth. These wells pump oil up from underground. Thousands of oil wells around the world are used to get oil from deep in the ground.
Much oil is located deep beneath ocean waters. Workers use a special platform called an oil rig. The oil rig floats far out in the ocean. Dozens of workers live on the oil rig for months at a time. They use special drills to get oil from hundreds or thousands of feet beneath the ocean surface.

        After three months of hard work, engineers and scientists from around the world finally stopped the oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. They were able to seal the well so no more oil could leak into the ocean water.
During those difficult months, many people worked to protect the waters and beaches around the Gulf of Mexico. One of the first things they did was spread oil booms in the water. An oil boom is like a floating wall that stops oil from spreading. Workers placed these oil booms all along the coast to keep oil away from beaches and wetlands. Once the oil was trapped by the oil booms, special boats came to clean the oil out of the water.

---

Even with all this work, thousands of gallons of oil still washed up on land. Workers spent many months cleaning oil from the beaches. Thanks to lots of hard work, people were able to prevent a complete environmental disaster. We will never know exactly how many fish, shrimp, and other sea animals died from the oil spill, but it could have been much worse. Most importantly, most of the wetlands were saved.
There are many things you can do to help protect the environment. To make things we use every day like bottles, cans, and paper, we need to use a natural resource. A natural resource is something from nature that people use to make products. To make cans, people dig mines and remove metals like aluminum from the earth. Trees are a natural resource used to make paper. Plastic bottles and toys are made from oil, which is also a natural resource.

---

Cans, bottles, and papers can be used again when we recycle them. When you recycle, old items get turned into new ones. This means we need less metal from mines, fewer trees get cut down, and less oil gets used to make new plastic. When we recycle, we help protect the environment!
Today there are over 7 billion people on Earth. About half of all the land is used to grow food for everyone. Towns, cities, and roads cover much of the remaining land. This does not leave much room for forests and other natural places where animals live.

---

People are finding smart ways to protect nature while still using its resources. Tree farms are one example. At a tree farm, workers cut down trees in one section while new trees grow in another section. This way, people can get the wood they need without cutting down all the forests.
People are also working to find cleaner ways to make electricity for homes and schools. Today, most electricity comes from oil and coal. Getting these fuels can cause accidents like oil spills. But we can also use wind and sunlight to make electricity. Giant windmills at wind farms create clean, safe electricity. It is possible to protect the environment and still get all the food and energy we need to live healthy lives.",,,,,Which of these is most like an oil boom?,MCQ,a special boat,a tree farm,a metal can,a floating wall,D,"Good try!

        After three months of hard work, engineers and scientists from around the world finally stopped the oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. They were able to seal the well so no more oil could leak into the ocean water.
During those difficult months, many people worked to protect the waters and beaches around the Gulf of Mexico. One of the first things they did was spread oil booms in the water. An oil boom is like a floating wall that stops oil from spreading. Workers placed these oil booms all along the coast to keep oil away from beaches and wetlands. Once the oil was trapped by the oil booms, special boats came to clean the oil out of the water.

Even with all this work, thousands of gallons of oil still washed up on land. Workers spent many months cleaning oil from the beaches.

People are finding smart ways to protect nature while still using its resources. Tree farms are one example. At a tree farm, workers cut down trees in one section while new trees grow in another section. This way, people can get the wood they need without cutting down all the forests.

        After three months of hard work, engineers and scientists from around the world finally stopped the oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. They were able to seal the well so no more oil could leak into the ocean water.
During those difficult months, many people worked to protect the waters and beaches around the Gulf of Mexico. One of the first things they did was spread oil booms in the water. An oil boom is like a floating wall that stops oil from spreading. Workers placed these oil booms all along the coast to keep oil away from beaches and wetlands. Once the oil was trapped by the oil booms, special boats came to clean the oil out of the water.

---

Even with all this work, thousands of gallons of oil still washed up on land. Workers spent many months cleaning oil from the beaches. Thanks to lots of hard work, people were able to prevent a complete environmental disaster. We will never know exactly how many fish, shrimp, and other sea animals died from the oil spill, but it could have been much worse. Most importantly, most of the wetlands were saved.
There are many things you can do to help protect the environment. To make things we use every day like bottles, cans, and paper, we need to use a natural resource. A natural resource is something from nature that people use to make products. To make cans, people dig mines and remove metals like aluminum from the earth. Trees are a natural resource used to make paper. Plastic bottles and toys are made from oil, which is also a natural resource.

---

Cans, bottles, and papers can be used again when we recycle them. When you recycle, old items get turned into new ones. This means we need less metal from mines, fewer trees get cut down, and less oil gets used to make new plastic. When we recycle, we help protect the environment!

        After three months of hard work, engineers and scientists from around the world finally stopped the oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. They were able to seal the well so no more oil could leak into the ocean water.
During those difficult months, many people worked to protect the waters and beaches around the Gulf of Mexico. One of the first things they did was spread oil booms in the water. An oil boom is like a floating wall that stops oil from spreading. Workers placed these oil booms all along the coast to keep oil away from beaches and wetlands. Once the oil was trapped by the oil booms, special boats came to clean the oil out of the water.

---

Even with all this work, thousands of gallons of oil still washed up on land. Workers spent many months cleaning oil from the beaches. Thanks to lots of hard work, people were able to prevent a complete environmental disaster. We will never know exactly how many fish, shrimp, and other sea animals died from the oil spill, but it could have been much worse. Most importantly, most of the wetlands were saved.
There are many things you can do to help protect the environment. To make things we use every day like bottles, cans, and paper, we need to use a natural resource. A natural resource is something from nature that people use to make products. To make cans, people dig mines and remove metals like aluminum from the earth. Trees are a natural resource used to make paper. Plastic bottles and toys are made from oil, which is also a natural resource.

---

Cans, bottles, and papers can be used again when we recycle them. When you recycle, old items get turned into new ones. This means we need less metal from mines, fewer trees get cut down, and less oil gets used to make new plastic. When we recycle, we help protect the environment!
Today there are over 7 billion people on Earth. About half of all the land is used to grow food for everyone. Towns, cities, and roads cover much of the remaining land. This does not leave much room for forests and other natural places where animals live.

---

People are finding smart ways to protect nature while still using its resources. Tree farms are one example. At a tree farm, workers cut down trees in one section while new trees grow in another section. This way, people can get the wood they need without cutting down all the forests.
People are also working to find cleaner ways to make electricity for homes and schools. Today, most electricity comes from oil and coal. Getting these fuels can cause accidents like oil spills.
