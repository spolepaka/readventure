He thought everything was perfect. But danger was coming. The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck.\"That lazy boy?\" the magician said. \"He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!\"The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, \"New lamps for old lamps!\"Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.\"I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,\" she thought.\n\n---\n\nThe princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.\"Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,\" the magician commanded. \"Move it to my home in North Africa.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.\"Find my daughter right now!\" the Sultan shouted. \"If you cannot bring her back, you will die!\"\n\n---\n\nPoor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.\"What do you wish?\" asked the genie of the ring.\"Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,\" Aladdin begged.\"I am sorry,\" said the genie. \"I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.\"\"Then please take me to be with my wife,\" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace. Aladdin and his wife made a plan to get the lamp back.\n\n---\n\nThe next day, the princess cooked a wonderful dinner for the magician. Aladdin hid so the magician could not see him. The princess put poison in the magician's cup. When the magician drank from the cup, he fell down and died.Aladdin ran into the room and looked for the lamp. He found it hidden in the magician's sleeve. Aladdin rubbed the lamp, and the huge genie appeared.\"What do you wish?\" the genie of the lamp asked in a loud voice.\"Take this palace with everything inside it,\" Aladdin commanded. \"Carry it back to Persia and put it next to the Sultan's home.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" the genie replied. The palace lifted up into the air and flew away.The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again! He ordered celebrations for a whole month. From that day on, Aladdin lived peacefully and safely with the princess. When the old Sultan died, Aladdin became the new ruler. He was fair and kind to all people, both rich and poor.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n\nDOK Level: 2 (Skills and Concepts)\nDifficulty: medium\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: Read the sentence.\"The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again!\"What does the word palace mean?\nA) a small house where poor people live\nB) a place where people go to buy things\nC) a building where soldiers stay and train\nD) a large building where important people live\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You may have thought \u201cpalace\u201d meant a small poor house, but the text says it is \u201cthe Sultan\u2019s daughter\u2019s palace\u201d and the genie moves \u201cthe palace with everything inside it,\u201d showing it\u2019s very big and for important people. That\u2019s why the correct answer is a large building where important people live. Next time, use the clues around the word\u2014who owns it and what happens to it\u2014to figure out its meaning.\n- B) You may have focused on the lamp seller and thought of a place to buy things, but look at \u201cThe next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter\u2019s palace was completely gone! So was the princess,\u201d which shows the palace is where she lives, not a shop. The correct answer is \u201ca large building where important people live.\u201d Next time, reread the sentences around the word and check that your meaning fits the whole scene, not just one detail.\n- C) You may have mixed up \u201cpalace\u201d with a place for soldiers, but the text says \u201cAladdin\u2019s palace,\u201d \u201chis daughter\u2019s palace,\u201d and that it was put next to the Sultan\u2019s home\u2014the princess and Aladdin live there, not soldiers. This shows palace means a large building where important people live. Next time, reread the sentence with the word and ask, \u201cWho lives here?\u201d to use context clues.\n- D) You successfully used context clues to figure out the meaning of the word \u201cpalace.\u201d The text supports this when it shows important people living there\u2014\u201cthe Sultan looked out his window\u201d at his daughter\u2019s palace\u2014and when the genie moves \u201cthis palace with everything inside it\u2026 next to the Sultan\u2019s home,\u201d showing it\u2019s a large building for important people. Remember: when you see a tricky word, look at who uses it and what happens around it to infer its meaning.\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (2), difficulty (medium), and CCSS (RL.3.4) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different focus, angle, or inference type)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must require a DIFFERENT inference, target a DIFFERENT relationship, or analyze a DIFFERENT aspect\n- Follow the original question's cognitive demand and structure\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Require DIFFERENT inferences or connections\n- Target DIFFERENT relationships or comparisons in the text\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that test the same inference\n- Do NOT ask about the same cause-effect or comparison multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.

What is he trying to get?\nA) Aladdin's genie lamp by tricking the princess.\nB) Goodwill by generously replacing worn-out lamps with new ones.\nC) Permission to work in the palace by offering free replacements.\nD) Any old lamp that looks valuable so he can resell it for profit.\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You successfully identified key details by naming what was stolen and how it happened. The text shows this when it says, \u201cThe princess gave Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic,\u201d after he called, \u201cNew lamps for old lamps!\u201d Remember to look for the who, what, and how in the same part of the passage and underline those clues to confirm your answer.\n- B) You may have thought he was being kind by replacing old lamps, but the story says he was the evil magician in disguise who shouted \u201cNew lamps for old lamps!\u201d and then \u201churried away with the real lamp,\u201d which shows a trick, not kindness. So the correct answer is that he got Aladdin\u2019s genie lamp by tricking the princess. Next time, reread what the character does after an offer to see if it is helpful or a trick.\n- C) You may have thought he was hired to work at the palace, but the story says he \u201cwalked by Aladdin\u2019s palace and shouted, \u2018New lamps for old lamps!\u2019\u201d and \u201cThe princess gave Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp to the magician,\u201d so he tricked her into giving him the lamp, not a job. The correct answer is that he got Aladdin\u2019s genie lamp by tricking the princess. Next time, reread the lines about the trade and ask, \u201cWhat did each person give or get?\u201d to be sure your answer matches the text.\n- D) You may have focused on the cry \u201cNew lamps for old lamps!\u201d and thought he wanted any valuable lamp to sell, but the story says, \u201cThis must be magic from the lamp!\u201d and shows he dressed up to trick the princess into giving him Aladdin\u2019s special lamp, which he then rubbed to use the genie. So the correct answer is that he wanted Aladdin\u2019s genie lamp by tricking the princess.

He thought everything was perfect. But danger was coming. The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck.\"That lazy boy?\" the magician said. \"He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!\"The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, \"New lamps for old lamps!\"Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.\"I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,\" she thought.\n\n---\n\nThe princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.\"Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,\" the magician commanded. \"Move it to my home in North Africa.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.\"Find my daughter right now!\" the Sultan shouted. \"If you cannot bring her back, you will die!\"\n\n---\n\nPoor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.\"What do you wish?\" asked the genie of the ring.\"Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,\" Aladdin begged.\"I am sorry,\" said the genie. \"I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.\"\"Then please take me to be with my wife,\" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace. Aladdin and his wife made a plan to get the lamp back.\n\n---\n\nThe next day, the princess cooked a wonderful dinner for the magician. Aladdin hid so the magician could not see him. The princess put poison in the magician's cup. When the magician drank from the cup, he fell down and died.Aladdin ran into the room and looked for the lamp. He found it hidden in the magician's sleeve. Aladdin rubbed the lamp, and the huge genie appeared.\"What do you wish?\" the genie of the lamp asked in a loud voice.\"Take this palace with everything inside it,\" Aladdin commanded. \"Carry it back to Persia and put it next to the Sultan's home.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" the genie replied. The palace lifted up into the air and flew away.The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again! He ordered celebrations for a whole month. From that day on, Aladdin lived peacefully and safely with the princess. When the old Sultan died, Aladdin became the new ruler. He was fair and kind to all people, both rich and poor.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n\nDOK Level: 3 (Strategic Thinking)\nDifficulty: hard\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: What is the central lesson or moral that this story teaches?\nA) Magic can solve any problem if you believe in it\nB) It is better to be poor than to have nice things\nC) Be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its true worth\nD) Always trust strangers who offer to trade with you because you might get unexpected rewards\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You may have focused on the magic and thought belief could fix everything. But the text shows the problem starts when the princess trades the \u201cold, ugly lamp,\u201d the magician uses it to steal the palace, and even the ring genie says he cannot move it\u2014so believing isn\u2019t enough. The lesson is to be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its worth. Strategy: Reread and ask, \u201cWhat choice caused the big problem?\u201d then pick the answer that warns against that mistake.\n- B) You may have thought the story says rich things are bad, but the text doesn\u2019t say that\u2014Aladdin stays wealthy and later becomes a kind ruler. Look at when the princess trades the \u201cold, ugly\u201d lamp for a shiny one and then the palace disappears; this shows the lesson: be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its worth. Next time, focus on the main mistake and its consequence to find the story\u2019s lesson.\n- C) You successfully found the story\u2019s lesson by noticing that the princess gave away something valuable without knowing its worth. The text supports this when it says, \u201cThe princess gave Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp to the magician,\u201d and afterward the palace was \u201ccompletely gone.\u201d Remember, to find the lesson in stories, look at a character\u2019s choice and what happens because of it.\n- D) You may have thought the trade led to a good surprise, but the text says, \u201cThe princess gave Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp to the magician\u2026 [he] moved the palace,\u201d which shows trusting the stranger caused big trouble, not rewards. The lesson is to be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its worth\u2014the princess didn\u2019t know the \u201cold, ugly\u201d lamp was magic and lost everything. Next time, check what happens after a choice in the story (the result) and choose the answer that matches that \n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (3), difficulty (hard), and CCSS (RL.3.2) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different analytical focus or synthesis)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must analyze a DIFFERENT theme, evaluate a DIFFERENT aspect, or synthesize DIFFERENT evidence\n- Follow the original question's strategic thinking demand\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Analyze DIFFERENT themes, purposes, or author's craft elements\n- Evaluate DIFFERENT aspects of the text\n- Synthesize DIFFERENT pieces of evidence\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that reach the same analytical conclusion\n- Do NOT ask about the same theme or author's purpose multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.

He thought everything was perfect. But danger was coming. The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck.\"That lazy boy?\" the magician said. \"He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!\"The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, \"New lamps for old lamps!\"Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.\"I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,\" she thought.\n\n---\n\nThe princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.\"Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,\" the magician commanded. \"Move it to my home in North Africa.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.\"Find my daughter right now!\" the Sultan shouted. \"If you cannot bring her back, you will die!\"\n\n---\n\nPoor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.\"What do you wish?\" asked the genie of the ring.\"Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,\" Aladdin begged.\"I am sorry,\" said the genie. \"I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.\"\"Then please take me to be with my wife,\" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace. Aladdin and his wife made a plan to get the lamp back.\n\n---\n\nThe next day, the princess cooked a wonderful dinner for the magician. Aladdin hid so the magician could not see him. The princess put poison in the magician's cup. When the magician drank from the cup, he fell down and died.Aladdin ran into the room and looked for the lamp. He found it hidden in the magician's sleeve. Aladdin rubbed the lamp, and the huge genie appeared.\"What do you wish?\" the genie of the lamp asked in a loud voice.\"Take this palace with everything inside it,\" Aladdin commanded. \"Carry it back to Persia and put it next to the Sultan's home.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" the genie replied. The palace lifted up into the air and flew away.The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again! He ordered celebrations for a whole month. From that day on, Aladdin lived peacefully and safely with the princess. When the old Sultan died, Aladdin became the new ruler. He was fair and kind to all people, both rich and poor.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n\nDOK Level: 3 (Strategic Thinking)\nDifficulty: hard\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: Why was it a mistake for the princess to trade the old lamp for a new one?\nA) Because the old lamp was magic, and the magician used it to take their palace away.\nB) Because the new lamp was shiny but did not help their family and caused trouble in the house.\nC) Because Aladdin wanted to keep every old thing in the palace and told her never to trade anything.\nD) Because the Sultan had a rule against trading with strangers in the street, and she broke that rule.\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You successfully explained cause and effect by identifying key details. The text shows this when \u201cthe princess gave Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp to the magician\u2026 Later that day, he rubbed the lamp\u2026 \u2018Take Aladdin\u2019s palace\u2026,\u2019 the magician commanded,\u201d and the genie replied, \u201cI hear and I obey.\u201d Remember, when a question asks why, look for what happened and the sentence that caused it\u2014especially commands or clues like because and so.\n- B) You may have focused on the shiny new lamp, but the text shows that the trouble came from the old magic lamp: the magician \u201crubbed the lamp,\u201d the genie appeared, and moved the palace \u201cto my home in North Africa.\u201d The new lamp did nothing; the magician used the old magic lamp to take their palace away. Next time, reread the lines that explain why something happens and make sure your answer matches those details.\n- C) It looks like you added something the story never says (that Aladdin told her never to trade). The text shows, \u201cThe princess gave Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp to the magician\u2026 Later that day, he rubbed the lamp\u2026 \u2018Take Aladdin\u2019s palace\u2026\u2019,\u201d so the palace was taken because the lamp was magic and the magician used it. Next time, stick to what the story says and underline the sentences that explain why the event happened.\n- D) You may have brought in an idea that isn\u2019t in the story (a Sultan\u2019s rule), but the text never says there was any rule about trading with strangers. Look at \u201cThe princess gave Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp to the magician\u2026 Later that day, he rubbed the lamp\u2026 \u2018Take Aladdin\u2019s palace\u2026\u2019\u201d which shows the magician used the magic lamp and genie to move the palace away. The correct answer is that the old lamp was magic and he used it to take their palace; next time, reread the lines that explain why the problem h\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (3), difficulty (hard), and CCSS (RL.3.2) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different analytical focus or synthesis)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must analyze a DIFFERENT theme, evaluate a DIFFERENT aspect, or synthesize DIFFERENT evidence\n- Follow the original question's strategic thinking demand\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Analyze DIFFERENT themes, purposes, or author's craft elements\n- Evaluate DIFFERENT aspects of the text\n- Synthesize DIFFERENT pieces of evidence\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that reach the same analytical conclusion\n- Do NOT ask about the same theme or author's purpose multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.

There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.\"What good is a book without pictures or talking?\" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!\n\n---\n\nAt first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!\" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.\n\n---\n\n\"Well!\" Alice thought to herself. \"After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!\"Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? \"I wonder how many miles I have fallen,\" Alice said out loud. \"I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.\"Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.\n\n---\n\nIn front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!\" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. \"That was not there before,\" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together. It was like cherry pie, custard, pineapple, turkey, candy, and buttered toast all at once. Alice drank it all up.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n\nDOK Level: 2 (Skills and Concepts)\nDifficulty: hard\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: What causes Alice to follow the White Rabbit down the hole?\nA) She wants to pick daisies.\nB) She is bored sitting by the river.\nC) The day is very hot.\nD) The Rabbit pulls out a watch.\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) It looks like you focused on an earlier detail\u2014Alice thinking about making a daisy chain\u2014but that\u2019s just something she considers. The text says, \u201cJust then\u2026 The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket!\u201d which is the surprising event that makes her jump up, so the correct answer is The Rabbit pulls out a watch. Next time, reread the lines with clue words like \u201cjust then\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d to be sure your answer matches the main event the question is asking about.\n- B) You may have focused on an earlier detail (Alice being bored by the river), but look at \u201cBut then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket!\u201d\u2014that sentence tells the surprising event the question is asking about. The correct answer is \u201cThe Rabbit pulls out a watch,\u201d because that\u2019s what makes Alice jump up and chase him. Next time, reread the lines around the clue words (like \u201camazing happened\u201d) and pick the answer that matches that exact moment in the text.\n- C) You may have focused on a setting detail; the text says \u201cIt was a very hot day,\u201d but the question asks what surprising thing happens. Right after, it says \u201cThe Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket!\u201d\u2014so the correct answer is The Rabbit pulls out a watch. Next time, reread the question and circle words like what happens or what does the character do to pick the event, not the background.\n- D) You successfully identified key details by noticing the surprising action the Rabbit takes. The text supports this when it says, \u201cThe Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket!\u201d Next time, when a question asks what happened, reread that part and look for action words that tell exactly what the character did.\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (2), difficulty (hard), and CCSS (RL.3.3) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different focus, angle, or inference type)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must require a DIFFERENT inference, target a DIFFERENT relationship, or analyze a DIFFERENT aspect\n- Follow the original question's cognitive demand and structure\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Require DIFFERENT inferences or connections\n- Target DIFFERENT relationships or comparisons in the text\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that test the same inference\n- Do NOT ask about the same cause-effect or comparison multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1. The ORIGINAL question\n2. ALL OTHER siblings you are generating (reference them by number: \"differs from Sibling 1 which asks about X\")\n\n## DOK 2 Requirements:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Demonstrate understanding beyond simple recall\n\n## Quality Requirements (CRITICAL - All Must Be Met)\n\n### Question Quality:\n1. **Template Fidelity**: Follow the original's cognitive demand and question structure\n2. **Inference Required**: Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n3. **Text Dependency**: Must require reading and understanding the passage\n4. **Clear and Precise**: NO ambiguous pronouns, double negatives, complex structure, vague language, multiple interpretations, or wordiness\n5. **Standard Alignment**: Question must directly assess the specific skill in RL.3.3\n6. **Passage Reference Accuracy**: Verify any paragraph/line references exist\n7. **Single Correct Answer**: EXACTLY ONE defensible correct answer; passage must not contradict itself\n\n### Answer Choice Quality:\n8. **Plausible Distractors**: Represent reasonable misconceptions\n9. **Grammatical Parallelism**: All choices MUST follow same grammatical structure\n10. **Homogeneity**: All choices MUST belong to same conceptual category\n11. **Specificity Balance**: All choices at same level of detail\n12. **Length Balance**: Within 10% word count\n13. **Semantic Distance**: NO synonyms, degree-only differences, or double-key risks\n\n### Feedback Requirements:\n**Format**: 1-4 sentences, encouraging tone, grade-appropriate\n\n**CORRECT answers**: Correctness explanation, textual evidence, skill reinforcement, reasoning model\n**INCORRECT answers**: Specific error, misconception diagnosis, textual refutation, correct guidance, actionable strategy, reasoning model\n\n## Output Format:\n```json\n{\n  \"sibling_questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"question text\",\n      \"option_1\": \"choice A\",\n      \"option_2\": \"choice B\",\n      \"option_3\": \"choice C\",\n      \"option_4\": \"choice D\",\n      \"correct_answer\": \"B\",\n      \"option_1_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"option_2_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"option_3_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"option_4_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"template_adaptation\": \"how you adapted\",\n      \"cognitive_process\": \"DOK 2 thinking type\",\n      \"quality_verification\": {\n        \"homogeneity_check\": \"all choices are [category]\",\n        \"specificity_check\": \"all at [detail level]\",\n        \"length_check\": \"balanced within 10%\",\n        \"semantic_distance_check\": \"no too-close pairs\",\n        \"single_correct_check\": \"only [letter] defensible\",\n        \"uniqueness_check\": \"Sibling [N]: asks about [X] - differs from ORIGINAL (which asks [Y]) and Sibling [other numbers] (which ask [Z])\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

She heard him say, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!\" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. \"That was not there before,\" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together. It was like cherry pie, custard, pineapple, turkey, candy, and buttered toast all at once. Alice drank it all up.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n\nDOK Level: 3 (Strategic Thinking)\nDifficulty: medium\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: What is the central message of this story about Alice's adventure?\nA) When you're bored, something interesting will eventually happen.\nB) You should always think carefully before making decisions.\nC) When you are bored, you should look for something exciting to do.\nD) Being curious can lead to amazing discoveries.\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You may have focused on the beginning detail that Alice was bored, but notice the text says she \u201cjumped up,\u201d chased the White Rabbit with a watch, tried the tiny key, and chose to drink the \u201cDRINK ME\u201d bottle\u2014her curiosity drives the adventure, not just waiting. That\u2019s why the central message is that being curious can lead to amazing discoveries. Next time, check that your answer matches what the character does across the whole story, not just one moment at the start.\n- B) You may have focused on the idea of being careful, but notice the text says \u201cShe did not think about how she would get back out again,\u201d she \u201cran after the Rabbit,\u201d and she drank the bottle labeled \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d which shows she isn\u2019t being cautious. These actions lead her to the White Rabbit, the long fall, and the beautiful garden, so the central message is that being curious can lead to amazing discoveries. Next time, check that your answer matches what happens again and again in the story, not j\n- C) You may have focused on Alice being bored at the start, but notice how she runs after the White Rabbit with a watch, follows it down the hole, tries the tiny key, and drinks the bottle labeled \u201cDRINK ME\u201d\u2014these show curiosity, not just looking for excitement. Those curious choices lead her to new places and surprises, so the central message is that being curious can lead to amazing discoveries. Next time, make sure your answer matches what the character does again and again in the whole passage, \n- D) Great job\u2014you identified the central message by noticing how Alice\u2019s curiosity leads to new discoveries. The text shows this when \u201cshe ran after the Rabbit and\u2026followed the Rabbit down the hole,\u201d which leads her to the tiny door, the beautiful garden, and the \u201cDRINK ME\u201d bottle.

There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.\"What good is a book without pictures or talking?\" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!\n\n---\n\nAt first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!\" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.\n\n---\n\n\"Well!\" Alice thought to herself. \"After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!\"Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? \"I wonder how many miles I have fallen,\" Alice said out loud. \"I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.\"Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.\n\n---\n\nIn front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!\" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. \"That was not there before,\" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together. It was like cherry pie, custard, pineapple, turkey, candy, and buttered toast all at once. Alice drank it all up.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.5 - Refer to parts of stories, dramas, and poems when writing or speaking about a text, using terms such as chapter, scene, and stanza; describe how each successive part builds on earlier sections.\n\nDOK Level: 2 (Skills and Concepts)\nDifficulty: medium\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: Read this outline and complete the missing part.I. Alice's AdventuresII. Eventssitting by the riverfollowing the White Rabbit_____\nA) picking the daisies\nB) talking to her sister\nC) reading her book\nD) finding the golden key\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You may have focused on something Alice only thought about, but the text says she just \u201cthought about making a chain of flowers\u201d and never picked the daisies. Later, she \u201csaw a little table\u2026 On top was a tiny, golden key,\u201d and that key opened the small door toward the garden\u2014so the correct answer is finding the golden key. Next time, make sure your answer matches what the character actually does, not just thinks about.\n- B) You may have focused on the beginning by her sister, but the story never shows Alice talking to her; later, in the room with many doors, \u201con top was a tiny, golden key\u2026 She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked!\u201d The correct answer is finding the golden key, because it let her open the little door toward the garden. Tip: Reread the part the question is asking about and choose a detail from that part, not from earlier in the story.\n- C) You may have focused on the small beginning detail about the book, but the text says \u201cShe looked at her sister\u2019s book once or twice\u201d and \u201cWhat good is a book without pictures or talking?\u201d, while the big event is \u201cOn top was a tiny, golden key\u2026 She tried the little golden key\u2026 It worked!\u201d The right answer is finding the golden key because it helps Alice open the little door to the garden. Next time, make sure your answer matches the big event of the passage, not just something mentioned at the st\n- D) You successfully identified key details by choosing \u201cfinding the golden key,\u201d which let Alice open the little door to the garden. The text supports this when it says, \u201cOn top was a tiny, golden key\u2026 She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked!\u201d Remember to look for sentences that show how the character solves a problem or moves forward, and use those clues to pick the best answer.\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (2), difficulty (medium), and CCSS (RL.3.5) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different focus, angle, or inference type)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must require a DIFFERENT inference, target a DIFFERENT relationship, or analyze a DIFFERENT aspect\n- Follow the original question's cognitive demand and structure\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Require DIFFERENT inferences or connections\n- Target DIFFERENT relationships or comparisons in the text\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that test the same inference\n- Do NOT ask about the same cause-effect or comparison multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.

There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.\"What good is a book without pictures or talking?\" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!\n\n---\n\nAt first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!\" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.\n\n---\n\n\"Well!\" Alice thought to herself. \"After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!\"Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? \"I wonder how many miles I have fallen,\" Alice said out loud. \"I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.\"Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.\n\n---\n\nIn front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!\" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. \"That was not there before,\" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together. It was like cherry pie, custard, pineapple, turkey, candy, and buttered toast all at once. Alice drank it all up.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.6 - Distinguish their own point of view from that of the narrator or those of the characters.\n\nDOK Level: 3 (Strategic Thinking)\nDifficulty: hard\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: Why did the author write this story about Alice?\nA) to explain what a rabbit hole is like\nB) to tell about a girl's unusual adventure\nC) to invite readers to go on an exciting adventure\nD) to show how to follow a white rabbit\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You may have focused on just one small part\u2014the rabbit hole\u2014but the text doesn\u2019t explain rabbit holes; it shows Alice chasing a talking White Rabbit with a watch, falling 'down, down, down,' finding a 'tiny, golden key,' and drinking from a bottle labeled 'DRINK ME.' Those events show the author\u2019s purpose is to tell about a girl\u2019s unusual adventure. Next time, check that your answer fits what most of the story is about, not just one detail.\n- B) You successfully identified the author\u2019s purpose by noticing the story is about Alice\u2019s strange journey. The text shows this with exciting events like \u201cThe Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket!\u201d and Alice \u201cfalling down what looked like a very deep well,\u201d plus the bottle labeled \u201cDRINK ME.\u201d Remember, when you see lots of unusual, make-believe events, think \u201cThis is to entertain,\u201d and ask, \u201cWhat is mostly happening in the story?\u201d\n- C) You may have thought the author was inviting you to join an adventure, but the text never talks to the reader; it just tells what Alice does\u2014\u201cAlice was getting very tired\u2026\u201d and \u201cAlice followed the Rabbit down the hole.\u201d That shows the purpose is to tell about a girl\u2019s unusual adventure, not to invite readers to go on one. Tip: Check if the passage uses \u201cyou\u201d to invite or if it tells a story about a character using names like \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cshe.\u201d\n- D) It looks like you focused on the detail that Alice follows the White Rabbit, but the passage isn\u2019t giving directions on how to do that; it tells many events\u2014she falls down a deep well, finds locked doors and a tiny door, and drinks a bottle that says \u201cDRINK ME.\u201d These details show the main idea is to tell about a girl\u2019s unusual adventure. Next time, check that your answer fits the whole story, not just one part.\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (3), difficulty (hard), and CCSS (RL.3.6) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different analytical focus or synthesis)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must analyze a DIFFERENT theme, evaluate a DIFFERENT aspect, or synthesize DIFFERENT evidence\n- Follow the original question's strategic thinking demand\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Analyze DIFFERENT themes, purposes, or author's craft elements\n- Evaluate DIFFERENT aspects of the text\n- Synthesize DIFFERENT pieces of evidence\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that reach the same analytical conclusion\n- Do NOT ask about the same theme or author's purpose multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.

The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.\"What a strange feeling!\" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.\n\n---\n\n\"I will eat this cake,\" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.\"How strange!\" cried Alice. \"Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!\" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.\n\n---\n\nThe White Rabbit was talking to himself. \"Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.\"Everything is so weird today!\" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!\"I wish I had not cried so much!\" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.\n\n---\n\nSoon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, \"Who are you?\" Alice felt confused. \"I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today.\" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important. \"One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.\" Alice broke off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n\nDOK Level: 2 (Skills and Concepts)\nDifficulty: medium\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: Alice and the White Rabbit both react in the same way when they have problems. How do they react?\nA) worriedly\nB) angrily\nC) silently\nD) bravely\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You successfully used context clues to figure out word meaning by noticing the Rabbit\u2019s feelings and actions. The text says, \u201cOh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\u201d and he \u201cdropped his gloves and fan and ran away,\u201d which shows he was acting worriedly. Remember to look at what a character says and does near the word to choose the best meaning next time.\n- B) You may have focused on the word \u201cangry,\u201d but in \u201cOh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\u201d the anger belongs to the Duchess, not the Rabbit. The Rabbit says \u201cOh no!,\u201d gets scared, drops his gloves and fan, and runs away\u2014these are signs he is worried, so \u201cworriedly\u201d is correct. Next time, check which character the feeling belongs to and use action clues to match the emotion.\n- C) You may have chosen \u201csilently\u201d because another part says Alice and the Caterpillar stared without speaking, but here \u201cThe White Rabbit was talking to himself\u201d and says, \u201cOh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\u201d, so he isn\u2019t silent. Those words show he feels nervous, so \u201cworriedly\u201d is the correct answer. Next time, reread the exact lines about the character and use clue words in the dialogue (like \u201cOh no!\u201d) to match the feeling.\n- D) You may have focused on the Rabbit moving quickly and thought that meant he was acting bravely, but look at \u201cOh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\u201d and \u201che got scared and ran away,\u201d which show he is worried, not brave. The correct answer is worriedly because his words and actions show worry. Next time, reread the sentences around the clue and pick the word that matches the feelings shown in the text.\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (2), difficulty (medium), and CCSS (RL.3.3) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different focus, angle, or inference type)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must require a DIFFERENT inference, target a DIFFERENT relationship, or analyze a DIFFERENT aspect\n- Follow the original question's cognitive demand and structure\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Require DIFFERENT inferences or connections\n- Target DIFFERENT relationships or comparisons in the text\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that test the same inference\n- Do NOT ask about the same cause-effect or comparison multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1. The ORIGINAL question\n2. ALL OTHER siblings you are generating (reference them by number: \"differs from Sibling 1 which asks about X\")\n\n## DOK 2 Requirements:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Demonstrate understanding beyond simple recall\n\n## Quality Requirements (CRITICAL - All Must Be Met)\n\n### Question Quality:\n1. **Template Fidelity**: Follow the original's cognitive demand and question structure\n2. **Inference Required**: Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n3. **Text Dependency**: Must require reading and understanding the passage\n4. **Clear and Precise**: NO ambiguous pronouns, double negatives, complex structure, vague language, multiple interpretations, or wordiness\n5. **Standard Alignment**: Question must directly assess the specific skill in RL.3.3\n6. **Passage Reference Accuracy**: Verify any paragraph/line references exist\n7. **Single Correct Answer**: EXACTLY ONE defensible correct answer; passage must not contradict itself\n\n### Answer Choice Quality:\n8. **Plausible Distractors**: Represent reasonable misconceptions\n9. **Grammatical Parallelism**: All choices MUST follow same grammatical structure\n10. **Homogeneity**: All choices MUST belong to same conceptual category\n11. **Specificity Balance**: All choices at same level of detail\n12. **Length Balance**: Within 10% word count\n13. **Semantic Distance**: NO synonyms, degree-only differences, or double-key risks\n\n### Feedback Requirements:\n**Format**: 1-4 sentences, encouraging tone, grade-appropriate\n\n**CORRECT answers**: Correctness explanation, textual evidence, skill reinforcement, reasoning model\n**INCORRECT answers**: Specific error, misconception diagnosis, textual refutation, correct guidance, actionable strategy, reasoning model\n\n## Output Format:\n```json\n{\n  \"sibling_questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"question text\",\n      \"option_1\": \"choice A\",\n      \"option_2\": \"choice B\",\n      \"option_3\": \"choice C\",\n      \"option_4\": \"choice D\",\n      \"correct_answer\": \"B\",\n      \"option_1_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"option_2_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"option_3_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"option_4_explanation\": \"feedback\",\n      \"template_adaptation\": \"how you adapted\",\n      \"cognitive_process\": \"DOK 2 thinking type\",\n      \"quality_verification\": {\n        \"homogeneity_check\": \"all choices are [category]\",\n        \"specificity_check\": \"all at [detail level]\",\n        \"length_check\": \"balanced within 10%\",\n        \"semantic_distance_check\": \"no too-close pairs\",\n        \"single_correct_check\": \"only [letter] defensible\",\n        \"uniqueness_check\": \"Sibling [N]: asks about [X] - differs from ORIGINAL (which asks [Y]) and Sibling [other numbers] (which ask [Z])\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.\"What a strange feeling!\" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.\n\n---\n\n\"I will eat this cake,\" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.\"How strange!\" cried Alice. \"Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!\" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.\n\n---\n\nThe White Rabbit was talking to himself. \"Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.\"Everything is so weird today!\" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!\"I wish I had not cried so much!\" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.\n\n---\n\nSoon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, \"Who are you?\" Alice felt confused. \"I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today.\" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important. \"One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.\" Alice broke off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n\nDOK Level: 3 (Strategic Thinking)\nDifficulty: medium\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: How does Alice get back to her normal size at the end of the passage?\nA) She uses the White Rabbit\u2019s fan and gloves.\nB) She drinks from the bottle again.\nC) She eats the cake.\nD) She eats the mushroom.\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You may be remembering another part of the story, but in this passage Alice does not use the White Rabbit\u2019s fan and gloves\u2014the Rabbit drops them and runs away. The text says, \u201cOne side of the mushroom will make you grow taller\u2026 She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size,\u201d so the correct answer is that she eats the mushroom. Next time, reread the part where the character solves the problem and make sure your answer matches the exact words in the passage.\n- B) You may have focused on an earlier detail (the bottle), but in this part she does not drink again. The text says, \u201cOne side of the mushroom will make you grow taller\u2026 Alice broke off a piece\u2026 She ate tiny bites,\u201d showing she eats the mushroom to change size. Next time, reread the sentences around the question\u2019s part of the story to be sure your answer matches that moment.\n- C) You may have focused on the earlier part when Alice eats the cake and grows very tall, but look at the end: \u201cOne side of the mushroom will make you grow taller\u2026 She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size,\u201d which shows she eats the mushroom. So the correct answer is: She eats the mushroom. Next time, reread the lines around the part the question is asking about to be sure your answer matches that moment in the story.\n- D) You successfully identified key details by noticing how Alice fixes her size. The text supports this when it says, \u201cOne side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter\u2026 She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size,\u201d showing she eats the mushroom. Next time, when a question asks what a character does, reread the part right after they get advice and look for action words to find the exact detail.\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (3), difficulty (medium), and CCSS (RL.3.2) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different analytical focus or synthesis)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must analyze a DIFFERENT theme, evaluate a DIFFERENT aspect, or synthesize DIFFERENT evidence\n- Follow the original question's strategic thinking demand\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Analyze DIFFERENT themes, purposes, or author's craft elements\n- Evaluate DIFFERENT aspects of the text\n- Synthesize DIFFERENT pieces of evidence\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that reach the same analytical conclusion\n- Do NOT ask about the same theme or author's purpose multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.

The text supports this with details like Alice \u201cgetting smaller and smaller,\u201d then \u201cgrowing bigger and bigger,\u201d and meeting the White Rabbit and a Caterpillar \u201csmoking a long pipe.\u201d Remember: ask if the text gives facts, gives directions, or tells a fun, imaginary story\u2014magic changes and talking animals are clues it\u2019s meant to entertain.\n- B) You may have focused on the animals (the White Rabbit and the Caterpillar), but notice the text shows make-believe events\u2014Alice shrinks and grows from a bottle, cake, and mushroom, and animals talk and wear gloves\u2014so it isn\u2019t teaching real facts about animals. The author\u2019s purpose is to entertain readers with a magical adventure. Next time, ask yourself: Is this giving true facts or telling a pretend story about a character\u2019s journey?\n- C) You may have focused on the \u201cEAT ME\u201d cake and thought it was about food, but the story shows magical events\u2014Alice shrinks and grows, cries a pool of tears, and meets the White Rabbit and the Caterpillar. These make-believe adventures show the author wrote this to entertain readers with a magical adventure, not to teach about different foods. Strategy: Ask yourself, \u201cIs this giving me facts to learn, or telling a fun, pretend story with characters and problems?\u201d\n- D) You may have focused on Alice trying to fix her size and thought the author was showing how to solve problems, but notice the magic details\u2014she shrinks and grows from a drink and cake, meets a talking White Rabbit and Caterpillar, and uses a magic mushroom\u2014which show a make\u2011believe adventure meant to entertain. The correct answer is entertain readers with a magical adventure.

The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.\"What a strange feeling!\" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.\n\n---\n\n\"I will eat this cake,\" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.\"How strange!\" cried Alice. \"Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!\" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.\n\n---\n\nThe White Rabbit was talking to himself. \"Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.\"Everything is so weird today!\" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!\"I wish I had not cried so much!\" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.\n\n---\n\nSoon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, \"Who are you?\" Alice felt confused. \"I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today.\" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important. \"One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.\" Alice broke off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.5 - Refer to parts of stories, dramas, and poems when writing or speaking about a text, using terms such as chapter, scene, and stanza; describe how each successive part builds on earlier sections.\n\nDOK Level: 3 (Strategic Thinking)\nDifficulty: hard\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: How does each section of the story build on Alice's problem of changing sizes?\nA) Each section shows Alice solving her size problems easily and quickly\nB) Each section repeats the same problem without Alice learning anything new\nC) Each section adds a new size change that creates bigger problems until she finds control\nD) Each section shows Alice getting bigger, then smaller, then finding a solution\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) You may have focused on the times Alice tries to fix things, but the text shows it isn\u2019t easy: she shrinks and can\u2019t reach the key, then grows to nine feet and can\u2019t fit through the door, cries a pool, and even shrinks into it. The correct idea is that each section adds a new size change that makes bigger problems until the Caterpillar explains the mushroom, and Alice uses tiny bites to control her size. Next time, reread what happens from beginning to end and pick the answer that fits the whole\n- B) You may have thought the story just repeats the same size problem, but it actually changes each time: first Alice is too small for the key, then too big for the door, and finally the Caterpillar tells her, \u201cOne side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter,\u201d and she eats tiny bites until she is back to normal. This shows each section adds a new size change that makes things harder until she learns to control her size. Next time, read from start to fini\n- C) You successfully recognized the sequence and cause-and-effect by seeing how each part shows Alice\u2019s size change creating a new problem until she gains control. The text shows this: \u201cshe was only ten inches tall\u2026 had forgotten the little golden key,\u201d then \u201cI am growing bigger and bigger\u2026 much too big to fit through the doorway,\u201d and later the Caterpillar says, \u201cOne side of the mushroom will make you grow taller,\u201d which helps her get back to normal. Remember to track what happens first, next, and \n- D) You may have looked for a repeating pattern, but the text shows first Alice gets smaller and can\u2019t reach the key, then she grows too big and even shrinks into her tear pool, and only in the last part the Caterpillar\u2019s mushroom helps her control her size. This means each part adds a new size change that causes bigger problems until she learns control\u2014not \u201cbigger, then smaller, then solution\u201d each time. Next time, reread each part and check that your answer matches what actually happens in all par\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (3), difficulty (hard), and CCSS (RL.3.5) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different analytical focus or synthesis)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must analyze a DIFFERENT theme, evaluate a DIFFERENT aspect, or synthesize DIFFERENT evidence\n- Follow the original question's strategic thinking demand\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Analyze DIFFERENT themes, purposes, or author's craft elements\n- Evaluate DIFFERENT aspects of the text\n- Synthesize DIFFERENT pieces of evidence\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that reach the same analytical conclusion\n- Do NOT ask about the same theme or author's purpose multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.

The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.\"What a strange feeling!\" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.\n\n---\n\n\"I will eat this cake,\" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.\"How strange!\" cried Alice. \"Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!\" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.\n\n---\n\nThe White Rabbit was talking to himself. \"Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.\"Everything is so weird today!\" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!\"I wish I had not cried so much!\" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.\n\n---\n\nSoon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, \"Who are you?\" Alice felt confused. \"I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today.\" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important. \"One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.\" Alice broke off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.\n\nTarget Standard: RL.3.5 - Refer to parts of stories, dramas, and poems when writing or speaking about a text, using terms such as chapter, scene, and stanza; describe how each successive part builds on earlier sections.\n\nDOK Level: 3 (Strategic Thinking)\nDifficulty: hard\nQuestion Type: Multiple Choice\n\n## Original Question (Use as Template):\nQuestion: In the story, which problem happens to Alice more than once?\nA) She grows and shrinks over and over after eating or drinking.\nB) She keeps losing her shoes.\nC) She keeps getting locked out of her house.\nD) She keeps turning invisible whenever she talks.\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nOriginal Feedback:\n- A) Great job! You successfully identified a pattern and key details by noticing that Alice changes size whenever she eats or drinks. The text shows this when it says, \u201cShe was getting smaller and smaller\u201d after the bottle, \u201cNow I am growing bigger and bigger!\u201d after the cake, and the Caterpillar explains, \u201cOne side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.\u201d Remember to look for repeated events and cause-and-effect clues (like what happens after she eats o\n- B) You may have focused on the line \u201cI can barely see my feet\u201d and turned it into \u201closing shoes,\u201d but the story never mentions shoes. Instead, it shows a pattern: she shrinks after drinking from the bottle, grows huge after eating the \u201cEAT ME\u201d cake, and later changes size again by eating mushroom pieces. So the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over after eating or drinking. Next time, reread for exact words and look for events that repeat to find the main idea.\n- C) You may have focused on the door mix-up and thought she was locked out of a house. But the story says she \u201cwas getting smaller,\u201d the cake made her \u201cgrowing bigger and bigger,\u201d later she was \u201cgetting smaller again,\u201d and the Caterpillar explains the mushroom can make her taller or shorter. This shows the main thing that keeps happening is her size changing after she eats or drinks, which is why the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over. Tip: look for what happens again and aga\n- D) You may have thought the line \u201cas she spoke\u201d meant she turned invisible, but the text says she is \u201cgetting smaller and smaller\u201d and later \u201cgrowing bigger and bigger\u201d\u2014it never says she disappears. The correct answer is that Alice keeps shrinking and growing after she eats or drinks (bottle, cake, mushroom). Next time, reread for the exact words that tell what changes (smaller, bigger, grow, shrink) and make sure your answer matches those words.\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 NEW sibling question(s) that:\n- Have the SAME DOK level (3), difficulty (hard), and CCSS (RL.3.5) as the original\n- Test the SAME passage/section as the original\n- Are DIFFERENT from the original (different analytical focus or synthesis)\n- Are DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER - each sibling must analyze a DIFFERENT theme, evaluate a DIFFERENT aspect, or synthesize DIFFERENT evidence\n- Follow the original question's strategic thinking demand\n\n## CRITICAL: Sibling Uniqueness Requirements\nWhen generating multiple siblings, ensure EACH ONE is meaningfully different:\n- Analyze DIFFERENT themes, purposes, or author's craft elements\n- Evaluate DIFFERENT aspects of the text\n- Synthesize DIFFERENT pieces of evidence\n- Have DIFFERENT correct answers when the passage supports it\n- Do NOT create questions that reach the same analytical conclusion\n- Do NOT ask about the same theme or author's purpose multiple times\n\n**Cross-Reference Requirement**: In each sibling's uniqueness_check, you MUST explicitly state how it differs from:\n1.
