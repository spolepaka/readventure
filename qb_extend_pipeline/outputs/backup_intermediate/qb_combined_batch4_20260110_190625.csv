        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.
Along the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first. Salmon happen to be one of the tastiest fish of all!",,,,,Which fact about salmon is clear from the information in the passage?,MCQ,Salmon are the only fish that travel in schools.,Salmon live only in fresh water their whole lives.,Salmon return to the same stream where they were born.,Salmon use maps to find their way home.,C,"You may have focused on one detail and thought salmon are the only fish that travel in schools. But the text says, “Some fish travel together… One type… is salmon,” which means other fish also travel in schools. The passage also states, “Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born,” so the correct answer is that salmon return to their birth stream. Next time, look for clue words like “some” and “one type,” and reread to be sure your answer matches what the text actually says.","You may have focused on a detail about fish in fresh water, but the passage says, “Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water,” and “Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born,” so they do not stay in fresh water their whole lives. The correct answer is that salmon return to the same stream where they were born because the text states this directly.

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.
Along the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first.

Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.
Along the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first. Salmon happen to be one of the tastiest fish of all!",,,,,Which bold word would help a student most quickly find information about fish that live in more than one type of water environment?,MCQ,The word 'aquatic' because all fish are aquatic,The word 'school' because fish groups travel together,The word 'salmon' because they live in both types of water,The word 'fresh water' because it names one water type,C,"This is incorrect.

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

---

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.
A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water. Now you can see why the Latin meaning of amphibian makes perfect sense!",,,,,"According to the passage, the changes in a tadpole's body help it",MCQ,swim faster,hide better,eat more,live on land,D,"You may have focused on swimming, but the text doesn’t say the changes help toads swim faster. It says, “After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land… Now the toad breathes air,” which shows the change is to live on land (the correct answer). Strategy: Reread what happens right after the change and choose the answer that matches that main idea.","You may have focused on safety (hiding), but the passage never says the change helps them “hide better.” Look at “the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land… its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air” and “As adults, they live on land”—this shows the change lets them live on land (the correct answer). Next time, reread the lines about the change and ask, “What new thing can the animal do now?” to be sure your answer matches the text.","You may have focused on food instead of the main change. The passage says, “After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land,” and it never says the toad eats more—only that adults eat insects. The correct answer is live on land; next time, reread the question and match your choice to the exact sentence in the text that answers it.","You successfully identified key details by recognizing that adult amphibians live on land. The text supports this when it says, “As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water,” and “the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land.” Remember to look for time clues like “After a few months” or “As adults” to match details to the right part of the life cycle.",2,medium,RI.3.3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,original

After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water.

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.
A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.

If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs.

When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.

Strategy: Check what most sentences are about and choose the answer that matches the whole section, not just the first detail you see.","Great job!

A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water.

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.
Crocodiles have the most powerful bite of all animals. Their bites are ten times stronger than a great white shark's bite. But it is easy to hold a crocodile's mouth closed because they use weak muscles to open their mouths. Even a third grader might be able to hold a crocodile's jaw shut!",,,,,The author of this passage would most likely agree that,MCQ,All reptiles are dangerous and should be avoided.,Most reptiles are not harmful to people.,Snakes are the only reptiles worth studying.,People should never go near any reptile.,B,"You may have thought all reptiles are dangerous because of the scary snake examples, but the text says, 'Most reptiles will not hurt people,' and even explains some 'only bite... if people attack them or startle them' and others 'rarely' attack.

Next time, look for clue words like most, some, and rarely to figure out the main idea.","You successfully identified key details by noticing the important fact about reptile safety. The text supports this when it says 'Most reptiles will not hurt people,' and then gives only a few dangerous examples. Remember to look for sentences that state facts and watch for words like 'most' or 'rarely' on questions like this.","You may have focused only on the snake details and turned them into an opinion, but the text says, “Many animals are reptiles… crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards,” and “Most reptiles will not hurt people.” This shows the main idea is about reptiles in general and their safety, so the correct answer is “Most reptiles are not harmful to people.” Next time, check that your choice matches what the whole passage says, not just one part.","You may have focused on the scary examples and thought they apply to all reptiles. But the text says, “Most reptiles will not hurt people,” and even explains that rattlesnakes and water moccasins bite only when attacked or rarely, and crocodiles “rarely attack humans,” so “never go near any reptile” goes too far.

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

---

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.
Crocodiles have the most powerful bite of all animals. Their bites are ten times stronger than a great white shark's bite.

        Hello! It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.
Birds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.

---

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

---

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

---

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.
Birds are famous for their beautiful songs. They sing to attract other birds and to mark their territory. Sometimes birds seem to sing just because they are happy.

        Hello! It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.
Birds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

---

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.

        Hello! It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.
Birds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.

---

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

---

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

---

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.
Birds are famous for their beautiful songs. They sing to attract other birds and to mark their territory. Sometimes birds seem to sing just because they are happy. Maybe they sing to remind us how wonderful and amazing the animal kingdom really is!",,,,,What does the word 'hatch' mean in this passage?,MCQ,when birds build a protective nest,when eggs break open and babies are born,when parent birds sit on their eggs,when baby birds learn to fly away,B,"Incorrect. Hatching is different from building nests. The passage uses 'hatch' when discussing what happens to eggs, not nest construction. Look for context clues around where the word appears.","Correct! The passage states 'Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food.' The context shows hatching is when eggs open and babies emerge. This demonstrates using surrounding text to determine word meaning.","Incorrect. Sitting on eggs is what parent birds do before hatching occurs.

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

---

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

---

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.
Birds are famous for their beautiful songs. They sing to attract other birds and to mark their territory. Sometimes birds seem to sing just because they are happy. Maybe they sing to remind us how wonderful and amazing the animal kingdom really is!",,,,,"Based on the entire passage, what key idea does the author emphasize about the bird group?",MCQ,Birds are the only animals with feathers and this makes them special.,Birds face many dangers from weather and other animals.,"Birds are diverse in their abilities, habitats, and characteristics.",Birds are better adapted for survival than other animal groups.,C,"Incorrect.

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

---

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

---

Mammals come in many different shapes and sizes. Some swim in oceans, some fly in the sky, and some walk on land. But all mammals share the same basic things - they have hair, backbones, make milk for their babies, and are warm-blooded. These characteristics help scientists know that an animal is a mammal, no matter how different it might look!",,,,,What is the purpose of this passage?,MCQ,to explain what makes an animal a mammal,to compare mammals to fish and birds,to teach readers how to take care of pet mammals,to tell stories about ocean animals,A,"You successfully found the main idea by noticing the passage explains the traits that make an animal a mammal. The text supports this when it says, “Do you know what makes an animal a mammal?” and lists features like “they have hair… make milk… are warm-blooded.” Remember to use the title and first paragraph to figure out what the author is mostly explaining in similar questions.","You may have thought the passage was comparing mammals to fish and birds, but those parts only show that dolphins, whales, and bats are still mammals.

Next time, read the first and last paragraph to find the main idea and check that your answer fits the whole passage.","You might have been thinking about how to care for pets, but the passage never gives care steps; instead it begins, “Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair…” and keeps listing traits with examples (whales, dolphins, bats). So the author’s purpose is to explain what makes an animal a mammal, not to teach pet care.

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

---

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

Mammals come in many different shapes and sizes. Some swim in oceans, some fly in the sky, and some walk on land.

These characteristics help scientists know that an animal is a mammal, no matter how different it might look!",,,,,Why does the author provide information about communication before discussing ocean and flying mammals?,MCQ,To prove mammals are smarter than all other animals,To establish mammals have complex abilities before showing unusual examples,To explain why whales and dolphins cannot talk to humans,To show that only land mammals can communicate effectively,B,"Incorrect.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

---

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows? Maybe you will be the first to find a feathered fish or a flying snail. It may sound silly now, but a hundred years ago, nobody knew that whales talked to each other. What will you discover?",,,,,Why do zoologists group animals by whether they have a backbone or not?,MCQ,to find out which animals are warm-blooded,to learn which animals breathe with gills,to discover which animals feed milk to babies,to see how they are the same and different,D,"It looks like you focused on a single example, but the text says, “Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different,” and then adds, “For example… some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.” So your choice is a detail, not the main reason; the correct answer is “to see how they are the same and different.” Next time, ask: “Is this the big idea or just one example?” and choose the answer that matches the whole sentence.","You may have focused on the detail about gills, but the text says, “Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different,” which is the main reason.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

---

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows?

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

---

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows?

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

---

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.
She loves working with young people and teaching them how to protect animals. She has written many books and has won many awards for her work. Even when she was 79 years old, she was still working to spread the message that animals need our protection!",,,,,Someone might read this passage to,MCQ,persuade others to protect animals.,learn facts about Jane Goodall.,enjoy a story about chimpanzees.,learn how to become a scientist.,B,"You may have focused on the part about protecting animals, which is just one detail, so “persuade others to protect animals” feels right.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

---

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

---

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.
She loves working with young people and teaching them how to protect animals. She has written many books and has won many awards for her work.

        Oceans are very deep bodies of water. People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.
The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

---

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

        Oceans are very deep bodies of water. People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.
The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

---

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

---

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

Like other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it. Their favorite spot is on a tree branch that has fallen into a pond. Tree frogs have been around for a very long time. They lived on Earth even before dinosaurs! You can find different types of tree frogs in North America, South America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

---

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

---

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

---

You never want a Komodo dragon to bite you or even lick you! Their saliva is full of dangerous germs that can make people very sick. The saliva in their mouth contains bacteria that can be deadly.

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

---

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

---

You never want a Komodo dragon to bite you or even lick you! Their saliva is full of dangerous germs that can make people very sick. The saliva in their mouth contains bacteria that can be deadly.

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

---

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

---

One beaver family can change the land around them in big ways. Their dams make the water in rivers rise higher. This floods the land nearby and creates a swamp called a wetland. A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.
Beavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave. Beavers are also very territorial. This means they don't want other beavers living in their space. They want to keep all the tasty tree bark for themselves! They will fight other beavers who try to move into their area.

When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

One beaver family can change the land around them in big ways. Their dams make the water in rivers rise higher. This floods the land nearby and creates a swamp called a wetland.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

One beaver family can change the land around them in big ways. Their dams make the water in rivers rise higher. This floods the land nearby and creates a swamp called a wetland. A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.
Beavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

One beaver family can change the land around them in big ways. Their dams make the water in rivers rise higher. This floods the land nearby and creates a swamp called a wetland. A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.
Beavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave. Beavers are also very territorial. This means they don't want other beavers living in their space. They want to keep all the tasty tree bark for themselves! They will fight other beavers who try to move into their area. Beavers are truly amazing animals to watch and learn about.",,,,,Why did the author most likely include the detail that wetlands 'often stay there long after [beavers] leave'?,MCQ,to show that beavers create lasting benefits for ecosystems even after moving on,to explain why beavers need to keep building new dams in different locations,to demonstrate that wetlands are permanent features of all river landscapes,to prove that beavers are careless about maintaining their own constructions,A,"Correct!
