His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. \"Tell me, young man,\" said the stranger. \"Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?\"\"Yes, I am,\" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. \"My dear nephew!\" he cried out. \"Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!\"\n\n---\n\nAladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. \"Come with me today,\" he said to the boy. \"I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city.\" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.\"Go gather some dry sticks,\" the magician told Aladdin. \"We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.\"Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.\n\n---\n\n\"Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,\" said the magician. \"It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.\"Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.\"Take this special ring,\" said the magician. \"It will keep you safe from any harm.\" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.\"Give me your hand, Uncle,\" Aladdin called out. \"Help me climb out!\"\"First, hand me the lamp,\" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. \"I cannot reach it right now,\" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him \"richer than any king in the world.\"What does this phrase mean?\n- A) Aladdin will have more money than he can count\n- B) Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom\n- C) Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave\n- D) Aladdin will meet kings from other countries\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.4.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What causes the magician to trap Aladdin in the cave?\n- A) Aladdin doesn't give him the lamp right away.\n- B) Aladdin won't to go into the cave.\n- C) Aladdin takes too many gems from the cave.\n- D) Aladdin breaks the magic ring on his finger.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 3, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

The magician is pretending to be Aladdin's uncle by acting like a loving family member. The text shows this is fake because he 'was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.' This emotional greeting is part of his trick to gain trust. When reading, watch for actions that don't match a character's true intentions.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the magician says 'What terrible news!' about the father's death, the text tells us he is 'not really Aladdin's uncle' and only came to get the lamp. His hug is an act to trick Aladdin, not genuine sadness. Look for clues that reveal a character's real motivations.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text doesn't mention the magician being cold, and hugging someone wouldn't be how to warm up. The magician hugs Aladdin to pretend he's a loving uncle. Consider what a character's actions are meant to accomplish in the story.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This happens at the beginning when the magician first meets Aladdin on the street, before they go to find the lamp. The magician is setting up his trick by acting like family.

The text shows the magician spoke 'magical words' and then 'the earth split open.' This vivid phrase describes how the spell made an entrance to the cave appear suddenly where there was solid ground. The dramatic language shows the power of the magic. When reading, notice how descriptive phrases help you picture important story events.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While earthquakes do split the earth, the text clearly states this happened because the magician 'spoke magical words in a loud voice.' It was magic, not a natural earthquake. Look for cause-and-effect relationships to understand why things happen in a story.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story doesn't suggest the mountain itself was dangerous or breaking apart naturally. The opening appeared specifically because of the magician's spell to reveal the treasure. Consider what caused an event rather than making assumptions about the setting.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The fire was for the perfumes the magician threw in while casting his spell. The earth splitting was caused by the magic spell itself, not by fire or heat.

It describes the magician's impatience in that specific moment when Aladdin won't give him the lamp immediately. Focus on the context where phrases appear in the story.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The text shows the magician wanted the lamp right away but Aladdin said he would give it after climbing out. The phrase 'could not wait any longer' explains why the magician trapped Aladdin - his impatience. The text says he 'only cared about getting the magic lamp.' When reading, connect phrases to the character's emotions and motivations at that moment.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The text describes them climbing 'higher and higher' until they reached a spot where the ground 'looked empty and bare' with no plants. This descriptive language shows they were at a harsh, desolate place high on the mountain. Authors use such descriptions to help readers picture the setting.

While the magician does perform magic at this location, the text doesn't suggest his previous magic killed the plants. The bare ground describes the natural harsh conditions at this high mountain spot. Stick to what the text directly states or strongly suggests.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

While the text tells us the magician 'was not really Aladdin's uncle,' Aladdin's mother doesn't know this is a lie. The passage says she 'welcomed the man into their home' and 'believed his words.' Be careful not to confuse what the reader knows with what characters know.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The text clearly states 'She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home.' This shows her two reactions: surprise at this news, but still being hospitable.

The text doesn't say the magician chose Aladdin for his strength. The magician specifically 'wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions.' This shows he valued obedience over physical ability. Look for what the text explicitly states about character motivations.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin didn't know about the lamp - the magician had to tell him where it was and how to get it.

Taking Aladdin to the countryside was necessary to find the lamp's location, but this action alone doesn't show the magician's true intentions. The key detail is that 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp,' not about helping Aladdin become a merchant as promised.

The story shows how the magician pretends to be family, makes big promises about helping Aladdin become rich, but really just wants to use him to get the lamp. When things don't go his way, he traps Aladdin. This teaches readers to be cautious about strangers with amazing offers. When finding a story's lesson, look at how events unfold and what happens because of characters' choices.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the magician does use magic for selfish purposes, the story focuses more on deception and false promises than on the proper use of magic. The central lesson is about trusting strangers who make big promises, not about magic itself. Consider what theme appears throughout the entire story, not just one element.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Actually, the story teaches the opposite! The magician pretends to be family but betrays Aladdin completely. The lesson warns against assuming someone is trustworthy just because they claim to be a relative. Pay attention to how the story's events support or contradict possible lessons.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story doesn't focus on hard work versus treasure-seeking. Aladdin agrees to help find treasure, and the problem isn't that he wants treasure - it's that he trusted a deceptive stranger.

While knowing the magical words shows he was prepared, this doesn't show planning before meeting Aladdin - he could have known these words already. The detail about traveling from North Africa specifically shows he planned this quest before finding Aladdin. Look for evidence of preparation that happened earliest in the timeline.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Bringing perfumes shows he was prepared for the spell, but doesn't necessarily show long-term planning before meeting Aladdin.

The detailed instructions show he knew about the lamp's location, but he could have learned this information at any time.

The text doesn't mention the magician's age or physical limitations.

The story begins by establishing that Aladdin's family is poor and his mother 'had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.'

While the father's job as a tailor is mentioned, it doesn't explain why Aladdin agrees to help. The important detail is that after the father died, the family became poor and struggled, making the magician's promise attractive.

The text explicitly states he 'had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich.' This is identified as his true purpose. When finding a character's goal, look for direct statements from the narrator about what the character really wants.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician has no interest in showing treasures to others. The text says 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp' for himself.

Because the magician 'could not wait any longer' and trapped Aladdin with the lamp still in the cave, he fails to get the lamp he came to Persia to find.

While the magician does have to leave alone, this isn't the main consequence of his impatience. The critical loss is that the lamp stays trapped in the cave, meaning his entire quest fails. Going back down the mountain is a minor detail compared to failing his whole mission. Focus on the most significant result of an action.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The perfumes were already used successfully to open the cave earlier. The consequence of the magician's impatience at the end is that he traps Aladdin before getting the lamp, ruining his whole plan. Don't confuse earlier events with the consequences of later actions.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician never truly intended to help Aladdin - that was always a lie.

This phrase appears right before the magician traps Aladdin in the cave. It reveals that the magician's sole focus on the lamp made him willing to harm Aladdin without hesitation.
