        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals.

Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals. Most crocodiles only eat once a week, but they can live for months without eating!",,,,,"In the passage, what does the phrase 'keep a constant temperature' mean when describing what all animals need?",MCQ,maintain the same measurement of heat in their bodies at all times,change their body heat regularly to match the weather outside,develop new ways to control temperature as they grow older,prefer living in places where the outside temperature never changes,A,"Correct! The passage explicitly states 'This means the temperature stays the same' right after introducing 'constant temperature.' The text then explains that if animals get too hot or cold, they get sick or die, confirming that 'constant' means maintaining a steady, unchanging internal temperature for survival.","Incorrect. This describes the opposite of constant. The passage explains that cold-blooded animals' temperatures do change with outside conditions, but then states they 'must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right,' showing that changing temperature is what animals try to avoid, not what 'constant' means.","Incorrect. 'Constant temperature' refers to maintaining steady body heat, not developing new control methods. The passage describes animals as either warm-blooded or cold-blooded from birth - their temperature regulation type doesn't change as they age. You're confusing the meaning of the phrase with how animals are classified.","Incorrect. While the passage does discuss where animals can live, 'constant temperature' specifically refers to internal body temperature, not external environment. In fact, warm-blooded animals maintain constant internal temperature even when living in places with changing weather, which is the opposite of what this choice suggests.",3,hard,RI.3.4,3,quiz_302106,2025-12-19T11:12:36.161385,Targets vocabulary phrase 'constant temperature' in section 3 about all animals' needs - differs from reference by asking about a different technical term and requiring understanding of explicitly defined vocabulary.,,all choices are definitions or explanations of what the phrase means,all at definitional level explaining the concept,"A=12 words, B=11 words, C=11 words, D=11 words - within 9% range","each offers distinct interpretations: unchanging internal heat, matching external conditions, developing new methods, environmental preference",only A matches the text's explicit definition 'the temperature stays the same',"targets section 3 vocabulary phrase with explicit text definition - asks about different technical term than reference questions, focusing on definitional understanding",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals. Most crocodiles only eat once a week, but they can live for months without eating!",,,,,Why does the fact that warm-blooded animals can live in many different places while cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places support the statement that 'All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies'?,MCQ,"It demonstrates that animals with internal temperature control can maintain constant temperature regardless of location, while animals dependent on external conditions need suitable environments",It proves that warm-blooded animals are more intelligent and can learn survival skills that cold-blooded animals cannot master,It shows that cold-blooded animals prefer living in comfortable places while warm-blooded animals enjoy challenging themselves,It explains that constant temperature is only important for warm-blooded animals but cold-blooded animals can survive with changing temperatures,A,"Correct! The passage states all animals need constant temperature or they'll 'get sick or even die,' then explains warm-blooded animals can achieve this anywhere using internal mechanisms (shivering, sweating, panting), while cold-blooded animals can only achieve it where external conditions (sun, water, mud) allow proper regulation. This habitat difference directly supports that constant temperature is universally necessary - each animal type just achieves it differently.","Incorrect. The passage never discusses intelligence, learning ability, or survival skills. The difference in habitat range relates to temperature regulation methods (internal vs. external), not to mental capabilities. This introduces ideas about animal intelligence that aren't mentioned or relevant to the temperature discussion.","Incorrect. The text doesn't describe preferences or enjoyment - it explains physical limitations and capabilities. Cold-blooded animals 'can only live in certain places' because they physically depend on environmental conditions, not because they prefer comfort. This mischaracterizes biological necessity as personal choice.","Incorrect. This directly contradicts the passage, which explicitly states 'cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.' All animals need constant temperature - the difference is in how they achieve it (internally vs. externally), not in whether they need it. This misreads a key point.",3,hard,RI.3.4,3,quiz_302107,2025-12-19T11:12:36.161430,Targets synthesis of habitat statement (section 4) with constant temperature requirement (section 3) - differs from reference by requiring explanation of how one piece of evidence supports another claim across sections.,,all choices are explanations of how habitat range supports the constant temperature statement,all at explanatory level describing logical relationships,"A=25 words, B=18 words, C=16 words, D=18 words - within 36% range, acceptable for complex synthesis question","each presents different explanations: regulation method enables habitat range, intelligence difference, preference-challenge, selective importance",only A correctly explains how different habitat ranges for each group supports universal constant temperature need,"targets cross-section synthesis (sections 3-4) asking how one statement supports another - requires complex reasoning about how evidence supports claims across multiple paragraphs, completely different from all other variants",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
