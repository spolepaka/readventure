story-1,story-1-q1,"The old lighthouse stood alone on the rocky cliff, its beam sweeping across the dark waters every night without fail. For sixty years, keeper Thomas Marsh had climbed the spiral staircase each evening to light the lamp. His hands, weathered and strong, knew every step by heart.

One stormy November night, the lighthouse lamp flickered and nearly died. Thomas worked frantically, his arthritic fingers fumbling with the machinery. Below, he knew, ships were counting on that light. 'Not on my watch,' he muttered, and with one final effort, the light blazed back to life.

The next morning, the harbor master came with news: a cargo ship had made it safely to port, guided by the lighthouse beam during the worst of the storm. Thomas smiled quietly and began his climb up the stairs once more.",2,RL.3.3,"Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.",Medium,MCQ,3

story-2,story-2-q1,"Honeybees are remarkable insects that play a vital role in our ecosystem. These small creatures are responsible for pollinating about one-third of the food we eat, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Without bees, many of our favorite foods would become scarce or disappear entirely.

A honeybee colony works together like a well-organized city. The queen bee lays eggs, worker bees gather nectar and pollen, and guard bees protect the hive from intruders. Each bee knows its job and performs it without being told.

Scientists have discovered that bees communicate through a special 'waggle dance.' When a worker bee finds flowers with good nectar, it returns to the hive and performs this dance to tell other bees exactly where to find the food. The direction and duration of the dance provide precise directions to the flower location.",2,RI.3.2,"Determine the main idea of a text; recount the key details and explain how they support the main idea.",Medium,MCQ,3
