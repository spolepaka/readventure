        Would you like to have a bedroom in outer space? Some astronauts do! The United States and other countries use the space shuttle to send astronauts to a special place called the International Space Station. This space station moves around Earth in a big circle. It is like a house floating in space. Three astronauts can live there at one time. They stay for six months before coming back to Earth.
The space station moves very far above our planet. It is so far up that the astronauts don't feel gravity like we do down here. Gravity is the force that pulls things down to Earth. When we lift our arms and legs on Earth, we have to work against gravity pulling us down. This is good for our bodies because it helps keep our muscles strong. But astronauts in space don't have gravity to work against. They float around instead of walking. This means they don't get much exercise just moving around. They have to run on a special machine at least once every day to keep their muscles strong and healthy.

---

Sleeping in space is very different from sleeping in your bed at home. The astronauts don't feel gravity, so they float freely inside the space station. This means they can sleep right side up, upside down, or sideways. It doesn't matter which way they face because there is no up or down in space! They have to zip themselves into sleeping bags that are attached to the walls. Otherwise, they would float away while they sleep. Do you think you would like sleeping while floating in the air?
Taking a shower in space is much harder than taking a shower at home. On Earth, water comes out of the shower head and falls down on your body because of gravity. Then the water runs off your skin and goes down the drain. But in space, water doesn't fall down at all! Instead, the water forms little floating bubbles. Astronauts have to catch the water and rub it on their skin with their hands. When they are done washing, the water doesn't drip off their bodies. They have to use special tools to scrape the water off their skin.

---

Astronauts must shower inside a small, closed room called a pod. This pod keeps all the water from floating away into the rest of the space station. If water bubbles floated around freely, they could cause big problems. The floating water might get into the computers and other important equipment. This could break the machines that keep the astronauts safe and healthy in space.
You can see that many things are different when people live in space instead of on Earth. That is why leaving the space station and coming back to our planet can be very hard for astronauts. It takes time for them to get used to living on Earth again. After spending months floating in space, they have trouble with Earth's gravity. Their arms and legs feel very heavy and hard to move. They find it difficult to stand up without falling over. They feel like they might tip over when they try to walk. But after a few weeks back on Earth, their bodies remember how to work with gravity.

        Would you like to have a bedroom in outer space? Some astronauts do! The United States and other countries use the space shuttle to send astronauts to a special place called the International Space Station. This space station moves around Earth in a big circle. It is like a house floating in space. Three astronauts can live there at one time. They stay for six months before coming back to Earth.
The space station moves very far above our planet. It is so far up that the astronauts don't feel gravity like we do down here. Gravity is the force that pulls things down to Earth. When we lift our arms and legs on Earth, we have to work against gravity pulling us down. This is good for our bodies because it helps keep our muscles strong. But astronauts in space don't have gravity to work against. They float around instead of walking. This means they don't get much exercise just moving around. They have to run on a special machine at least once every day to keep their muscles strong and healthy.

---

Sleeping in space is very different from sleeping in your bed at home. The astronauts don't feel gravity, so they float freely inside the space station. This means they can sleep right side up, upside down, or sideways. It doesn't matter which way they face because there is no up or down in space! They have to zip themselves into sleeping bags that are attached to the walls. Otherwise, they would float away while they sleep. Do you think you would like sleeping while floating in the air?
Taking a shower in space is much harder than taking a shower at home. On Earth, water comes out of the shower head and falls down on your body because of gravity. Then the water runs off your skin and goes down the drain. But in space, water doesn't fall down at all! Instead, the water forms little floating bubbles. Astronauts have to catch the water and rub it on their skin with their hands. When they are done washing, the water doesn't drip off their bodies. They have to use special tools to scrape the water off their skin.

---

Astronauts must shower inside a small, closed room called a pod. This pod keeps all the water from floating away into the rest of the space station. If water bubbles floated around freely, they could cause big problems. The floating water might get into the computers and other important equipment. This could break the machines that keep the astronauts safe and healthy in space.
You can see that many things are different when people live in space instead of on Earth. That is why leaving the space station and coming back to our planet can be very hard for astronauts. It takes time for them to get used to living on Earth again. After spending months floating in space, they have trouble with Earth's gravity. Their arms and legs feel very heavy and hard to move. They find it difficult to stand up without falling over. They feel like they might tip over when they try to walk. But after a few weeks back on Earth, their bodies remember how to work with gravity.

Sleeping in space is very different from sleeping in your bed at home. The astronauts don't feel gravity, so they float freely inside the space station. This means they can sleep right side up, upside down, or sideways. It doesn't matter which way they face because there is no up or down in space! They have to zip themselves into sleeping bags that are attached to the walls. Otherwise, they would float away while they sleep. Do you think you would like sleeping while floating in the air?
Taking a shower in space is much harder than taking a shower at home. On Earth, water comes out of the shower head and falls down on your body because of gravity. Then the water runs off your skin and goes down the drain. But in space, water doesn't fall down at all! Instead, the water forms little floating bubbles. Astronauts have to catch the water and rub it on their skin with their hands. When they are done washing, the water doesn't drip off their bodies. They have to use special tools to scrape the water off their skin.

Astronauts must shower inside a small, closed room called a pod. This pod keeps all the water from floating away into the rest of the space station. If water bubbles floated around freely, they could cause big problems. The floating water might get into the computers and other important equipment. This could break the machines that keep the astronauts safe and healthy in space.
You can see that many things are different when people live in space instead of on Earth. That is why leaving the space station and coming back to our planet can be very hard for astronauts. It takes time for them to get used to living on Earth again. After spending months floating in space, they have trouble with Earth's gravity. Their arms and legs feel very heavy and hard to move. They find it difficult to stand up without falling over. They feel like they might tip over when they try to walk. But after a few weeks back on Earth, their bodies remember how to work with gravity.

The space station moves very far above our planet. It is so far up that the astronauts don't feel gravity like we do down here. Gravity is the force that pulls things down to Earth.

        John Cabot was an explorer from Italy who had the same dream as Columbus. He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.
Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

---

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

---

Cabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.

---

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump. This pump removed water that leaked into the ship. It was a terrible job because the water smelled awful and made sailors sick.
The food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard. Sailors had to soak it in water to make it soft enough to eat. The good thing about hardtack was that it would not spoil on long trips. But if it got wet, bugs called weevils could get into it. Many sailors got sick from eating such poor food. Lots of them got a disease called scurvy. Today we know that scurvy happens when people don't eat enough fresh fruits and vegetables. Back then, people didn't know this, so many sailors died from this disease.",,,,,"What was one important result of Cabot’s trips, even though he did not find Asia?",MCQ,England used his trips to claim land in North America.,He found a short route to Asia that many sailors used.,"He kept perfect records, so people know every detail of his life.","He brought plenty of fresh food, so no sailors got sick.",A,"Great job—you identified key details by picking what happened because of Cabot’s trips.

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump.

The food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard. Sailors had to soak it in water to make it soft enough to eat. The good thing about hardtack was that it would not spoil on long trips. But if it got wet, bugs called weevils could get into it.

        John Cabot was an explorer from Italy who had the same dream as Columbus. He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.
Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

        John Cabot was an explorer from Italy who had the same dream as Columbus. He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.
Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

---

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

---

Cabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump. This pump removed water that leaked into the ship. It was a terrible job because the water smelled awful and made sailors sick.
The food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard. Sailors had to soak it in water to make it soft enough to eat. The good thing about hardtack was that it would not spoil on long trips. But if it got wet, bugs called weevils could get into it.

Many things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.

Cabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.
In 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.

Cabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.

Life on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump. This pump removed water that leaked into the ship. It was a terrible job because the water smelled awful and made sailors sick.
The food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard. Sailors had to soak it in water to make it soft enough to eat. The good thing about hardtack was that it would not spoil on long trips. But if it got wet, bugs called weevils could get into it. Many sailors got sick from eating such poor food. Lots of them got a disease called scurvy. Today we know that scurvy happens when people don't eat enough fresh fruits and vegetables. Back then, people didn't know this, so many sailors died from this disease.",,,,,"Based on the details in the passage, which statement best describes what the author wants readers to understand about exploration in the 1400s?",MCQ,Explorers who failed to achieve their goals contributed nothing to their countries.,Explorations could have important results even when explorers didn't accomplish their original goals.,The Northwest Passage was more important to find than discovering new lands.,Keeping detailed records was the most important part of any exploration voyage.,B,"Incorrect. The passage shows the opposite—Cabot didn't reach Asia but still helped England claim North American territory and discovered valuable fishing areas. The author emphasizes that even failed missions had significance, contradicting the idea that failures contributed nothing.","Correct! The passage demonstrates this theme throughout: Cabot sought Asia but found North America, didn't find the Northwest Passage but gave England territorial claims, and discovered valuable fishing grounds while pursuing a different goal. By synthesizing these examples, you recognize the author's broader message about how exploration outcomes often differed from intentions but still mattered.","Incorrect. While the Northwest Passage was a goal, the author never argues it was more important than other discoveries. The passage actually emphasizes how Cabot's 'unintended' discoveries—land claims and fishing areas—were valuable, suggesting all discoveries had worth.","Incorrect. Record-keeping is mentioned as a problem with studying Cabot, but the author doesn't present it as the most important aspect of exploration.
