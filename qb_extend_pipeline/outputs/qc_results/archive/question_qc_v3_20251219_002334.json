Options A, B, and D begin with 'how,' 'that,' and 'when' respectively (noun clause structures), while option C begins with 'why' followed by a modal verb construction ('should never'). The structures are inconsistent: A uses 'how' + noun phrase, B uses 'that' + complete clause, C uses 'why' + modal statement, and D uses 'when' + past tense clause.",

        "response": "Options B, C, and D are NOT plausible distractors. Option B ('that Alice enjoys swimming in unusual places') is obviously wrong as the passage clearly shows Alice is distressed, not enjoying herself. Option C ('why Alice should never cry about her problems') presents a moralistic lesson that is not supported by the text. Option D ('when Alice learned to control her emotions better') is factually incorrect as Alice doesn't learn to control her emotions in this scene. These distractors would be easily eliminated by students who read the passage.",

Option A addresses literary technique (cause and effect/consequences), option B addresses character preference/enjoyment, option C addresses moral lessons, and option D addresses character development timing.

The question asks students to analyze why the author included a specific detail (Alice swimming in her own tears) and connect it to earlier events in the story (Alice crying earlier). The correct answer (A) demonstrates understanding of how the author structures the narrative with earlier actions leading to consequences.",

The passage clearly establishes that Alice cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water, and then she fell into that pool and had to swim in it. This is a clear cause-and-effect relationship showing how earlier actions lead to later consequences. No other answer choice can be reasonably defended based on the passage content.",
