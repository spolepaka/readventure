        Have you been to the dentist recently? Do you remember the special tool your dentist used? It has a small mirror on the end. This tool helps the dentist see all your teeth. The dentist can look at the back of your teeth and even see the teeth way in the back of your mouth. Without this mirror, the dentist could not do a good job taking care of your teeth!
A mirror has a smooth, shiny surface that bounces light back to your eyes. When light hits something smooth and shiny, we say it reflects the light. You already know that light travels in straight lines until it hits something. If light hits glass, it goes right through. If light hits something thick like a wall, it gets blocked and makes a shadow. But when light hits a mirror, it bounces right back to you.
When people make mirrors, they take glass and coat it with hot, silvery metals. Then they let it cool down. This coating makes the mirror shiny so it can reflect all the light that hits it. Did you know there are different types of mirrors? You probably use a plane mirror every morning when you get ready for school. A plane mirror has a flat surface. When you look in a plane mirror, you look almost the same size as you really are.

---

Plane mirrors are used in many tools that help us see things better. Cameras, telescopes, and microscopes sometimes use plane mirrors. Some toys use plane mirrors too. Have you ever looked through a toy called a kaleidoscope? A kaleidoscope is a tube with plane mirrors inside. It also has tiny pieces of colored glass and beads sealed inside. You look through a small hole at one end and point it toward the light. When you turn the tube, you see beautiful, colored patterns.
There are two other types of mirrors that are different from plane mirrors. Plane mirrors have flat surfaces, but concave and convex mirrors have surfaces that curve. The shiny side of a concave mirror curves inward like the inside of a spoon. The shiny side of a convex mirror curves outward like the back of a spoon.

---

Concave and convex mirrors work differently than plane mirrors. In a plane mirror, you look about the same size as you really are. But in concave and convex mirrors, you can look much larger or much smaller than you really are. These curved mirrors are very useful in many ways.
Concave mirrors can help provide heat using light from the sun. Remember that sunlight gives us both light and heat energy. The large concave mirror reflects the sun's energy so people can warm their hands or bodies when they are outside. Convex mirrors are useful too. The next time you ride on a bus, look at the mirrors on the sides. Most buses and big trucks have a small convex mirror next to the regular plane mirror. The convex mirror makes things look smaller, but it shows a much wider area. This helps drivers see more and avoid hitting things they might miss in the regular plane mirror.

---

Now you can see how useful mirrors are in our everyday lives. Mirrors can also be lots of fun! A circus or carnival sometimes has a place called the ""Funhouse"" or ""House of Mirrors."" If you go inside, there are many concave and convex mirrors everywhere. When you look in these mirrors, you might not recognize yourself! Your reflection gets changed and twisted.

If light hits something thick like a wall, it gets blocked and makes a shadow. But when light hits a mirror, it bounces right back to you.
When people make mirrors, they take glass and coat it with hot, silvery metals. Then they let it cool down. This coating makes the mirror shiny so it can reflect all the light that hits it. Did you know there are different types of mirrors? You probably use a plane mirror every morning when you get ready for school. A plane mirror has a flat surface. When you look in a plane mirror, you look almost the same size as you really are.

---

Plane mirrors are used in many tools that help us see things better. Cameras, telescopes, and microscopes sometimes use plane mirrors. Some toys use plane mirrors too. Have you ever looked through a toy called a kaleidoscope? A kaleidoscope is a tube with plane mirrors inside. It also has tiny pieces of colored glass and beads sealed inside. You look through a small hole at one end and point it toward the light. When you turn the tube, you see beautiful, colored patterns.
There are two other types of mirrors that are different from plane mirrors. Plane mirrors have flat surfaces, but concave and convex mirrors have surfaces that curve. The shiny side of a concave mirror curves inward like the inside of a spoon. The shiny side of a convex mirror curves outward like the back of a spoon.

---

Concave and convex mirrors work differently than plane mirrors. In a plane mirror, you look about the same size as you really are. But in concave and convex mirrors, you can look much larger or much smaller than you really are. These curved mirrors are very useful in many ways.
Concave mirrors can help provide heat using light from the sun. Remember that sunlight gives us both light and heat energy. The large concave mirror reflects the sun's energy so people can warm their hands or bodies when they are outside. Convex mirrors are useful too. The next time you ride on a bus, look at the mirrors on the sides. Most buses and big trucks have a small convex mirror next to the regular plane mirror. The convex mirror makes things look smaller, but it shows a much wider area. This helps drivers see more and avoid hitting things they might miss in the regular plane mirror.

The shiny side of a concave mirror curves inward like the inside of a spoon. The shiny side of a convex mirror curves outward like the back of a spoon.

---

Concave and convex mirrors work differently than plane mirrors. In a plane mirror, you look about the same size as you really are. But in concave and convex mirrors, you can look much larger or much smaller than you really are. These curved mirrors are very useful in many ways.
Concave mirrors can help provide heat using light from the sun. Remember that sunlight gives us both light and heat energy. The large concave mirror reflects the sun's energy so people can warm their hands or bodies when they are outside. Convex mirrors are useful too. The next time you ride on a bus, look at the mirrors on the sides. Most buses and big trucks have a small convex mirror next to the regular plane mirror. The convex mirror makes things look smaller, but it shows a much wider area. This helps drivers see more and avoid hitting things they might miss in the regular plane mirror.

        Have you been to the dentist recently? Do you remember the special tool your dentist used? It has a small mirror on the end. This tool helps the dentist see all your teeth. The dentist can look at the back of your teeth and even see the teeth way in the back of your mouth. Without this mirror, the dentist could not do a good job taking care of your teeth!
A mirror has a smooth, shiny surface that bounces light back to your eyes. When light hits something smooth and shiny, we say it reflects the light. You already know that light travels in straight lines until it hits something. If light hits glass, it goes right through. If light hits something thick like a wall, it gets blocked and makes a shadow. But when light hits a mirror, it bounces right back to you.
When people make mirrors, they take glass and coat it with hot, silvery metals. Then they let it cool down. This coating makes the mirror shiny so it can reflect all the light that hits it. Did you know there are different types of mirrors? You probably use a plane mirror every morning when you get ready for school. A plane mirror has a flat surface. When you look in a plane mirror, you look almost the same size as you really are.

Plane mirrors are used in many tools that help us see things better. Cameras, telescopes, and microscopes sometimes use plane mirrors. Some toys use plane mirrors too. Have you ever looked through a toy called a kaleidoscope? A kaleidoscope is a tube with plane mirrors inside. It also has tiny pieces of colored glass and beads sealed inside. You look through a small hole at one end and point it toward the light. When you turn the tube, you see beautiful, colored patterns.

        Have you been to the dentist recently? Do you remember the special tool your dentist used? It has a small mirror on the end. This tool helps the dentist see all your teeth. The dentist can look at the back of your teeth and even see the teeth way in the back of your mouth. Without this mirror, the dentist could not do a good job taking care of your teeth!
A mirror has a smooth, shiny surface that bounces light back to your eyes. When light hits something smooth and shiny, we say it reflects the light. You already know that light travels in straight lines until it hits something. If light hits glass, it goes right through. If light hits something thick like a wall, it gets blocked and makes a shadow. But when light hits a mirror, it bounces right back to you.
When people make mirrors, they take glass and coat it with hot, silvery metals. Then they let it cool down. This coating makes the mirror shiny so it can reflect all the light that hits it. Did you know there are different types of mirrors? You probably use a plane mirror every morning when you get ready for school. A plane mirror has a flat surface. When you look in a plane mirror, you look almost the same size as you really are.

---

Plane mirrors are used in many tools that help us see things better. Cameras, telescopes, and microscopes sometimes use plane mirrors. Some toys use plane mirrors too. Have you ever looked through a toy called a kaleidoscope? A kaleidoscope is a tube with plane mirrors inside. It also has tiny pieces of colored glass and beads sealed inside. You look through a small hole at one end and point it toward the light. When you turn the tube, you see beautiful, colored patterns.
There are two other types of mirrors that are different from plane mirrors. Plane mirrors have flat surfaces, but concave and convex mirrors have surfaces that curve. The shiny side of a concave mirror curves inward like the inside of a spoon. The shiny side of a convex mirror curves outward like the back of a spoon.

---

Concave and convex mirrors work differently than plane mirrors. In a plane mirror, you look about the same size as you really are. But in concave and convex mirrors, you can look much larger or much smaller than you really are. These curved mirrors are very useful in many ways.
Concave mirrors can help provide heat using light from the sun. Remember that sunlight gives us both light and heat energy. The large concave mirror reflects the sun's energy so people can warm their hands or bodies when they are outside. Convex mirrors are useful too. The next time you ride on a bus, look at the mirrors on the sides. Most buses and big trucks have a small convex mirror next to the regular plane mirror. The convex mirror makes things look smaller, but it shows a much wider area. This helps drivers see more and avoid hitting things they might miss in the regular plane mirror.

        Have you ever wondered why inventors are so important? They have helped make everyone's life better in some way. If there was a special place to honor the best inventors, Thomas Alva Edison would be one of the first people chosen.
Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847, in a small town in northern Ohio. He was the youngest of seven children. His parents were Sam and Nancy Edison. His friends called him Al. As a young boy, Al was often sick. He could not go to school until he was eight years old. When Al had scarlet fever as a child, it damaged his hearing. He became mostly deaf. But being sick did not stop Al from being curious about the world around him.
Al asked many questions that even his teachers could not answer. He wanted to know things like ""Why is the sky blue?"" and ""How does fire work?"" He was curious about everything in nature. Al liked to figure out answers to problems by himself.

---

When Al was 12 years old, he got a job selling newspapers on trains near his home. On the train, he heard people talking about new ideas and inventions. Even though he was deaf, Al learned by listening carefully to their stories. At age 15, Al got a job working with telegraph machines. A telegraph sends messages using electric signals. Over the next six years, he became very good at operating the telegraph. Even though he could not hear well, he could feel the vibrations in the wire.
Al loved working with electric machines. He found a way to make the telegraph work faster and better. He sold his idea to the Western Union Telegraph Company for $40,000. That was a lot of money back then! With the money he earned, Al set up his first laboratory to continue doing experiments.

---

When Al's work grew too big for his first lab, he built a much larger laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He hired some of the smartest scientists and engineers from around the world to work with him. Much of his early work was about sound and how it travels. People called him the Wizard of Menlo Park because his inventions seemed almost magical.
In his new lab, Al discovered how to make Alexander Graham Bell's new telephone sound louder and clearer. He got a patent for his invention and sold it for $100,000. A patent is a special paper that says you own the rights to your invention. His next invention was the phonograph. This amazing machine could record sound on a metal cylinder wrapped in thin metal foil. Al played ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" for his fellow scientists. This was the first time anyone had ever listened to recorded music!

---

The invention that made Edison most famous came next. In 1879, he created the first incandescent electric light bulb. An incandescent light bulb glows when electricity passes through it. Three years later, he lit up 85 homes at the same time in New York City. This was the beginning of the age of electric light.
By the time Edison stopped working, he had patents on over 1,000 inventions. Some of his other important inventions included the kinetoscope, which was a machine for showing moving pictures, and the microphone, which made voices sound louder. What people sometimes forget is that many of Edison's experiments failed at first. He caused explosions in his labs and had to start over many times. But he never gave up. He always stayed positive because he knew each failure brought him closer to his next great success!",,,,,How does the passage show what Edison did after earning money from his telegraph invention?,MCQ,He bought equipment to create his first laboratory,He traveled to meet other inventors around the world,He paid teachers to answer his childhood questions,"He purchased a building in Menlo Park, New Jersey",A,"Correct! The passage states that 'With the money he earned, Al set up his first laboratory to continue doing experiments.' This shows the direct result of earning $40,000 - he invested it in creating a space for his work.","Incorrect.

        Have you ever wondered why inventors are so important? They have helped make everyone's life better in some way. If there was a special place to honor the best inventors, Thomas Alva Edison would be one of the first people chosen.
Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847, in a small town in northern Ohio. He was the youngest of seven children. His parents were Sam and Nancy Edison. His friends called him Al. As a young boy, Al was often sick. He could not go to school until he was eight years old. When Al had scarlet fever as a child, it damaged his hearing. He became mostly deaf. But being sick did not stop Al from being curious about the world around him.
Al asked many questions that even his teachers could not answer. He wanted to know things like ""Why is the sky blue?"" and ""How does fire work?"" He was curious about everything in nature. Al liked to figure out answers to problems by himself.

---

When Al was 12 years old, he got a job selling newspapers on trains near his home. On the train, he heard people talking about new ideas and inventions. Even though he was deaf, Al learned by listening carefully to their stories. At age 15, Al got a job working with telegraph machines. A telegraph sends messages using electric signals. Over the next six years, he became very good at operating the telegraph. Even though he could not hear well, he could feel the vibrations in the wire.
Al loved working with electric machines. He found a way to make the telegraph work faster and better. He sold his idea to the Western Union Telegraph Company for $40,000. That was a lot of money back then! With the money he earned, Al set up his first laboratory to continue doing experiments.

---

When Al's work grew too big for his first lab, he built a much larger laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He hired some of the smartest scientists and engineers from around the world to work with him. Much of his early work was about sound and how it travels. People called him the Wizard of Menlo Park because his inventions seemed almost magical.
In his new lab, Al discovered how to make Alexander Graham Bell's new telephone sound louder and clearer. He got a patent for his invention and sold it for $100,000. A patent is a special paper that says you own the rights to your invention. His next invention was the phonograph. This amazing machine could record sound on a metal cylinder wrapped in thin metal foil. Al played ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" for his fellow scientists. This was the first time anyone had ever listened to recorded music!

---

The invention that made Edison most famous came next. In 1879, he created the first incandescent electric light bulb. An incandescent light bulb glows when electricity passes through it. Three years later, he lit up 85 homes at the same time in New York City. This was the beginning of the age of electric light.
By the time Edison stopped working, he had patents on over 1,000 inventions. Some of his other important inventions included the kinetoscope, which was a machine for showing moving pictures, and the microphone, which made voices sound louder. What people sometimes forget is that many of Edison's experiments failed at first. He caused explosions in his labs and had to start over many times. But he never gave up. He always stayed positive because he knew each failure brought him closer to his next great success!",,,,,How does the passage use Edison's childhood experiences to explain his later work?,MCQ,His early sickness caused him to focus on medical inventions,His unanswered questions developed his problem-solving approach,His deafness made him avoid working with sound technology,His large family inspired him to create household items,B,"Incorrect.

        Have you ever wondered why inventors are so important? They have helped make everyone's life better in some way. If there was a special place to honor the best inventors, Thomas Alva Edison would be one of the first people chosen.
Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847, in a small town in northern Ohio. He was the youngest of seven children. His parents were Sam and Nancy Edison. His friends called him Al. As a young boy, Al was often sick. He could not go to school until he was eight years old. When Al had scarlet fever as a child, it damaged his hearing. He became mostly deaf. But being sick did not stop Al from being curious about the world around him.
Al asked many questions that even his teachers could not answer. He wanted to know things like ""Why is the sky blue?"" and ""How does fire work?"" He was curious about everything in nature. Al liked to figure out answers to problems by himself.

---

When Al was 12 years old, he got a job selling newspapers on trains near his home. On the train, he heard people talking about new ideas and inventions. Even though he was deaf, Al learned by listening carefully to their stories. At age 15, Al got a job working with telegraph machines. A telegraph sends messages using electric signals. Over the next six years, he became very good at operating the telegraph. Even though he could not hear well, he could feel the vibrations in the wire.
Al loved working with electric machines. He found a way to make the telegraph work faster and better. He sold his idea to the Western Union Telegraph Company for $40,000. That was a lot of money back then! With the money he earned, Al set up his first laboratory to continue doing experiments.

---

When Al's work grew too big for his first lab, he built a much larger laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He hired some of the smartest scientists and engineers from around the world to work with him. Much of his early work was about sound and how it travels. People called him the Wizard of Menlo Park because his inventions seemed almost magical.
In his new lab, Al discovered how to make Alexander Graham Bell's new telephone sound louder and clearer. He got a patent for his invention and sold it for $100,000. A patent is a special paper that says you own the rights to your invention. His next invention was the phonograph. This amazing machine could record sound on a metal cylinder wrapped in thin metal foil. Al played ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" for his fellow scientists. This was the first time anyone had ever listened to recorded music!

The invention that made Edison most famous came next. In 1879, he created the first incandescent electric light bulb. An incandescent light bulb glows when electricity passes through it. Three years later, he lit up 85 homes at the same time in New York City. This was the beginning of the age of electric light.
By the time Edison stopped working, he had patents on over 1,000 inventions. Some of his other important inventions included the kinetoscope, which was a machine for showing moving pictures, and the microphone, which made voices sound louder.

        Loki had a plan to fix what he had done to Sif's hair. He left Asgard and went down the Rainbow Bridge to Earth. Then he traveled below Earth to a place called Nidavellir. This was the realm of the dwarves. The dwarves were short creatures who lived deep under the ground. They were grouchy and surly, which means they were bad-tempered and rude. But they were also master workers who could make amazing things.
Loki was good at talking to people. He knew how to flatter the dwarves by saying nice things about their work. He went to their workshop and watched them. ""What wonderful work you do!"" Loki said. ""I have never seen better workers! How do you make such beautiful things?""
The dwarves smiled because they liked being praised. Loki kept talking sweetly to them. ""You must be the best workers in the world,"" he said. ""Your work is amazing, but I have a job that might be too hard even for you.""

---

The dwarves stopped hitting their anvils and looked up. An anvil is a heavy iron block that workers use to shape metal. ""Too hard for us?"" said one dwarf. ""I think not! There is nothing we cannot make!""
""Could you make golden hair as beautiful as Sif's hair?"" Loki asked.
""We can make it!"" shouted the dwarves. And make it they did. They took a bar of gold and heated it in their forge. A forge is a special fire used to heat metal. Then they began hitting it with their hammers. They stretched the gold into tubes, then into thin threads. Each dwarf was a skilled craftsman who knew exactly what to do.
The dwarves worked day and night for a week. When the hair was done, it was wonderful to see. It sparkled like gold but felt soft like real hair.

---

Loki had what he needed, but he was very clever. He knew he had made Odin and Thor angry. So he decided to trick the dwarves into making gifts for them too.
""This hair is amazing!"" he said. ""You are truly masters of your work. But surely there are some things even you cannot make.""
""There is nothing we cannot make!"" said the dwarves.
Loki asked them to make a silver spear that never missed its target. The dwarves made it in a week. Then Loki asked for a magical boat that could sail in the air and fold up to fit in a pocket. They made that too!

---

Loki left the underground world with all three gifts. He went up past Earth and walked up the Rainbow Bridge. Heimdall was the guardian who watched the bridge. A guardian is someone who protects a place. Heimdall saw Loki and let him pass.
Odin called all the gods together for a meeting. Loki put the golden hair on Sif's head. It was beautiful, and Sif was very happy. Next, Loki gave Odin the silver spear. Odin was pleased with his gift. Then Loki gave Thor the magical boat. Even Thor, who did not like Loki, had to say the boat was wonderful.

The dwarves smiled because they liked being praised. Loki kept talking sweetly to them. ""You must be the best workers in the world,"" he said. ""Your work is amazing, but I have a job that might be too hard even for you.""

The dwarves stopped hitting their anvils and looked up. An anvil is a heavy iron block that workers use to shape metal. ""Too hard for us?"" said one dwarf. ""I think not! There is nothing we cannot make!""
""Could you make golden hair as beautiful as Sif's hair?"" Loki asked.
""We can make it!"" shouted the dwarves. And make it they did. They took a bar of gold and heated it in their forge. A forge is a special fire used to heat metal. Then they began hitting it with their hammers. They stretched the gold into tubes, then into thin threads. Each dwarf was a skilled craftsman who knew exactly what to do.
The dwarves worked day and night for a week. When the hair was done, it was wonderful to see. It sparkled like gold but felt soft like real hair.

Loki had what he needed, but he was very clever. He knew he had made Odin and Thor angry. So he decided to trick the dwarves into making gifts for them too.

        Loki had a plan to fix what he had done to Sif's hair. He left Asgard and went down the Rainbow Bridge to Earth. Then he traveled below Earth to a place called Nidavellir. This was the realm of the dwarves. The dwarves were short creatures who lived deep under the ground. They were grouchy and surly, which means they were bad-tempered and rude. But they were also master workers who could make amazing things.
Loki was good at talking to people. He knew how to flatter the dwarves by saying nice things about their work. He went to their workshop and watched them. ""What wonderful work you do!"" Loki said. ""I have never seen better workers! How do you make such beautiful things?""
The dwarves smiled because they liked being praised. Loki kept talking sweetly to them. ""You must be the best workers in the world,"" he said. ""Your work is amazing, but I have a job that might be too hard even for you.""

The dwarves stopped hitting their anvils and looked up. An anvil is a heavy iron block that workers use to shape metal. ""Too hard for us?"" said one dwarf. ""I think not! There is nothing we cannot make!""
""Could you make golden hair as beautiful as Sif's hair?"" Loki asked.
""We can make it!"" shouted the dwarves. And make it they did. They took a bar of gold and heated it in their forge. A forge is a special fire used to heat metal. Then they began hitting it with their hammers. They stretched the gold into tubes, then into thin threads. Each dwarf was a skilled craftsman who knew exactly what to do.
The dwarves worked day and night for a week. When the hair was done, it was wonderful to see. It sparkled like gold but felt soft like real hair.

Odin called all the gods together for a meeting. Loki put the golden hair on Sif's head. It was beautiful, and Sif was very happy. Next, Loki gave Odin the silver spear.

        Loki had a plan to fix what he had done to Sif's hair. He left Asgard and went down the Rainbow Bridge to Earth. Then he traveled below Earth to a place called Nidavellir. This was the realm of the dwarves. The dwarves were short creatures who lived deep under the ground. They were grouchy and surly, which means they were bad-tempered and rude. But they were also master workers who could make amazing things.
Loki was good at talking to people. He knew how to flatter the dwarves by saying nice things about their work. He went to their workshop and watched them. ""What wonderful work you do!"" Loki said. ""I have never seen better workers! How do you make such beautiful things?""
The dwarves smiled because they liked being praised. Loki kept talking sweetly to them. ""You must be the best workers in the world,"" he said. ""Your work is amazing, but I have a job that might be too hard even for you.""

---

The dwarves stopped hitting their anvils and looked up. An anvil is a heavy iron block that workers use to shape metal. ""Too hard for us?"" said one dwarf. ""I think not! There is nothing we cannot make!""
""Could you make golden hair as beautiful as Sif's hair?"" Loki asked.
""We can make it!"" shouted the dwarves. And make it they did. They took a bar of gold and heated it in their forge. A forge is a special fire used to heat metal. Then they began hitting it with their hammers. They stretched the gold into tubes, then into thin threads. Each dwarf was a skilled craftsman who knew exactly what to do.
The dwarves worked day and night for a week. When the hair was done, it was wonderful to see. It sparkled like gold but felt soft like real hair.

---

Loki had what he needed, but he was very clever. He knew he had made Odin and Thor angry. So he decided to trick the dwarves into making gifts for them too.
""This hair is amazing!"" he said. ""You are truly masters of your work. But surely there are some things even you cannot make.""
""There is nothing we cannot make!"" said the dwarves.

        Thor had a hammer that he carried everywhere. It was called Mjöllnir. This hammer was magical. The dwarves made it in their underground workshop. When Thor threw the hammer, it would fly through the air and hit its target. There would be a flash of lightning and a loud boom of thunder. Then, the hammer would fly back to Thor's hand like a boomerang. Thor loved his hammer more than anything. He never went anywhere without it. He even slept with it next to him. The first thing he did every morning was grab Mjöllnir.
But one morning, Thor woke up and found that Mjöllnir was gone. He looked everywhere but could not find it. ""Loki!"" said Thor. ""Loki has stolen my hammer!"" Thor found Loki and grabbed him by the throat. He lifted him up so his legs hung in the air. Loki could barely breathe. ""I... did... not... take... it,"" he said with difficulty. ""Liar!"" roared Thor.

        Thor had a hammer that he carried everywhere. It was called Mjöllnir. This hammer was magical. The dwarves made it in their underground workshop. When Thor threw the hammer, it would fly through the air and hit its target. There would be a flash of lightning and a loud boom of thunder. Then, the hammer would fly back to Thor's hand like a boomerang. Thor loved his hammer more than anything. He never went anywhere without it. He even slept with it next to him. The first thing he did every morning was grab Mjöllnir.
But one morning, Thor woke up and found that Mjöllnir was gone. He looked everywhere but could not find it. ""Loki!"" said Thor. ""Loki has stolen my hammer!"" Thor found Loki and grabbed him by the throat. He lifted him up so his legs hung in the air. Loki could barely breathe. ""I... did... not... take... it,"" he said with difficulty. ""Liar!"" roared Thor.

---

Thor glared at Loki and waited for the truth. However, Loki said nothing more. Thor waited longer, but still Loki said nothing. Thor was puzzled. He began to think maybe Loki was telling the truth this time. Thor set Loki down and went to speak with Odin.
Odin sent his two ravens out on a long journey. They flew around the world and came back with news. ""It was Thrym, the giant,"" the ravens said. ""He stole the hammer."" Thrym was a giant who was quite ugly but very rich. Odin sent Loki to speak with Thrym. Loki made the long trip to the world of the giants. Thrym greeted him with a big smile. ""Hello, Loki,"" he said. ""How are the gods today?"" ""They are not well,"" said Loki. ""Someone has taken Thor's hammer.""

""What a pity!"" said Thrym, but he did not seem upset at all. Loki did not mince words. ""Was it you?"" he asked directly. Loki expected Thrym to say no, but that is not what happened. ""Yes!"" said Thrym. ""I stole the hammer! I have buried it six miles underground, where no one can ever find it!"" Thrym paused to laugh and enjoy his own villainy. Then he spoke again. ""Tell Thor he will never see his hammer again—unless..."" ""Unless what?"" Loki asked. ""Unless Freya will agree to marry me,"" said Thrym.
""Not likely,"" said Loki. ""She's already married, you know."" ""What do I care?"" said Thrym. ""It will never happen,"" said Loki. ""Then I will keep Thor's hammer,"" said Thrym. ""No Freya, no hammer!""

---

Loki went back and told the gods that Thrym had stolen the hammer. ""He says he will give it back, but only if Freya agrees to marry him."" ""What?"" said Freya.

Then, the hammer would fly back to Thor's hand like a boomerang. Thor loved his hammer more than anything. He never went anywhere without it. He even slept with it next to him. The first thing he did every morning was grab Mjöllnir.
But one morning, Thor woke up and found that Mjöllnir was gone. He looked everywhere but could not find it. ""Loki!"" said Thor. ""Loki has stolen my hammer!"" Thor found Loki and grabbed him by the throat. He lifted him up so his legs hung in the air. Loki could barely breathe. ""I... did... not... take... it,"" he said with difficulty. ""Liar!"" roared Thor.

Thor glared at Loki and waited for the truth. However, Loki said nothing more. Thor waited longer, but still Loki said nothing. Thor was puzzled. He began to think maybe Loki was telling the truth this time. Thor set Loki down and went to speak with Odin.
Odin sent his two ravens out on a long journey. They flew around the world and came back with news. ""It was Thrym, the giant,"" the ravens said. ""He stole the hammer."" Thrym was a giant who was quite ugly but very rich. Odin sent Loki to speak with Thrym. Loki made the long trip to the world of the giants. Thrym greeted him with a big smile. ""Hello, Loki,"" he said. ""How are the gods today?"" ""They are not well,"" said Loki. ""Someone has taken Thor's hammer.""

""What a pity!"" said Thrym, but he did not seem upset at all. Loki did not mince words. ""Was it you?"" he asked directly. Loki expected Thrym to say no, but that is not what happened. ""Yes!"" said Thrym. ""I stole the hammer! I have buried it six miles underground, where no one can ever find it!"" Thrym paused to laugh and enjoy his own villainy. Then he spoke again. ""Tell Thor he will never see his hammer again—unless..."" ""Unless what?"" Loki asked. ""Unless Freya will agree to marry me,"" said Thrym.
""Not likely,"" said Loki. ""She's already married, you know."" ""What do I care?"" said Thrym. ""It will never happen,"" said Loki. ""Then I will keep Thor's hammer,"" said Thrym. ""No Freya, no hammer!""

        Thor had a hammer that he carried everywhere. It was called Mjöllnir. This hammer was magical. The dwarves made it in their underground workshop. When Thor threw the hammer, it would fly through the air and hit its target. There would be a flash of lightning and a loud boom of thunder. Then, the hammer would fly back to Thor's hand like a boomerang. Thor loved his hammer more than anything. He never went anywhere without it. He even slept with it next to him. The first thing he did every morning was grab Mjöllnir.
But one morning, Thor woke up and found that Mjöllnir was gone. He looked everywhere but could not find it. ""Loki!"" said Thor. ""Loki has stolen my hammer!"" Thor found Loki and grabbed him by the throat. He lifted him up so his legs hung in the air. Loki could barely breathe. ""I... did... not... take... it,"" he said with difficulty. ""Liar!"" roared Thor.

Thor glared at Loki and waited for the truth. However, Loki said nothing more. Thor waited longer, but still Loki said nothing. Thor was puzzled. He began to think maybe Loki was telling the truth this time. Thor set Loki down and went to speak with Odin.
Odin sent his two ravens out on a long journey. They flew around the world and came back with news. ""It was Thrym, the giant,"" the ravens said. ""He stole the hammer."" Thrym was a giant who was quite ugly but very rich. Odin sent Loki to speak with Thrym. Loki made the long trip to the world of the giants. Thrym greeted him with a big smile.

But Thor did not like this idea. ""Never!"" he roared. ""I will not do it!""

Thor was barrel-chested and very strong. It was not easy fitting him into Freya's clothes. Tyr and Loki had already spent ten minutes trying to tighten the waist-strings on Freya's corset.
""Why did I let you fools talk me into this?"" said Thor.
""Take a deep breath,"" said Loki.
Thor took a breath. Then, Loki and Tyr began pulling on the corset strings.

        The gods sat around feeling confused. None of them knew how to get Thor's hammer back from Thrym. At last, Loki spoke up.
""Maybe we could trick Thrym,"" he said.
""Tell us more,"" said Odin.
""We can't send the real Freya,"" Loki said. ""That's clear. But maybe we could send a fake Freya.""
""A fake Freya?"" said Odin. ""What do you mean?""
""I mean one of us could dress up as Freya.""

""Well,"" said Loki, with a big grin, ""it's Thor's hammer. Maybe he should go get it himself.""
""What?"" said Thor. ""You want me—the great and mighty Thor—to dress up as a girl? You rogue!""
Thor reached out for Loki. He wanted to grab him. Tyr, the god of war, had to hold him back.

""Calm down,"" said Loki. ""It will just be for a few hours, until we get your hammer back. I will go with you. I will dress up and pretend to be your maid of honor.""
But Thor did not like this idea. ""Never!"" he roared. ""I will not do it!""
""Well,"" Loki said, ""does anyone else have a better plan?""
No one said anything.
At last, Odin's wife, Frigga, spoke. ""Loki's plan just might work,"" she said. ""It's our best chance.""
Frigga placed her lovely, white hand on Thor's massive shoulder. ""Thor,"" she said. ""I know you don't like the plan, but would you do it for me—and for Freya?""
Thor grumbled and groaned, but in the end he said yes.
""It's just for a few hours,"" Odin said, patting Thor on the back. ""A man can stand anything for a few hours.""

At last the gods got Thor into his corset. They brought him a fancy white dress and dainty white shoes. They put veils on him that covered his face and helped conceal his thick, red beard.
Loki got dressed as well. Freya came to add the final touch. She took off the famous golden necklace she always wore and placed it around Thor's neck.

These specific details demonstrate the significant effort required.","This answer is incorrect because Thor's initial refusal shows his emotional resistance, not the physical effort of creating the disguise. The question asks how the author shows the disguise requires effort, and Thor's objections are about his feelings, not about the actual work of dressing him.","This answer is incorrect because the author never directly compares Thor's appearance to Freya's beauty.

        The gods sat around feeling confused. None of them knew how to get Thor's hammer back from Thrym. At last, Loki spoke up.
""Maybe we could trick Thrym,"" he said.
""Tell us more,"" said Odin.
""We can't send the real Freya,"" Loki said. ""That's clear. But maybe we could send a fake Freya.""
""A fake Freya?"" said Odin. ""What do you mean?""

Thor reached out for Loki. He wanted to grab him. Tyr, the god of war, had to hold him back.

""Calm down,"" said Loki. ""It will just be for a few hours, until we get your hammer back. I will go with you. I will dress up and pretend to be your maid of honor.""
But Thor did not like this idea. ""Never!"" he roared. ""I will not do it!""
""Well,"" Loki said, ""does anyone else have a better plan?""
No one said anything.
At last, Odin's wife, Frigga, spoke. ""Loki's plan just might work,"" she said. ""It's our best chance.""
Frigga placed her lovely, white hand on Thor's massive shoulder. ""Thor,"" she said. ""I know you don't like the plan, but would you do it for me—and for Freya?""
Thor grumbled and groaned, but in the end he said yes.
""It's just for a few hours,"" Odin said, patting Thor on the back. ""A man can stand anything for a few hours.""

The gods sent a message to Thrym. Thrym wrote back. He said that the wedding would happen in eight days. Eight days later, the gods were working hard to get Thor ready.
""Pull!"" shouted Frigga.
""I'm pulling as hard as I can!"" replied Tyr.
Thor was barrel-chested and very strong. It was not easy fitting him into Freya's clothes. Tyr and Loki had already spent ten minutes trying to tighten the waist-strings on Freya's corset.

Loki got dressed as well. Freya came to add the final touch. She took off the famous golden necklace she always wore and placed it around Thor's neck.

Even when Thor reaches for him angrily, Loki continues to promote his plan and volunteers to accompany Thor on the mission.

        The gods sat around feeling confused. None of them knew how to get Thor's hammer back from Thrym. At last, Loki spoke up.
""Maybe we could trick Thrym,"" he said.
""Tell us more,"" said Odin.
""We can't send the real Freya,"" Loki said. ""That's clear. But maybe we could send a fake Freya.""
""A fake Freya?"" said Odin. ""What do you mean?""
""I mean one of us could dress up as Freya.""
""I see,"" said Odin. ""Who did you think should do it?""
""Well,"" said Loki, with a big grin, ""it's Thor's hammer. Maybe he should go get it himself.""
""What?"" said Thor. ""You want me—the great and mighty Thor—to dress up as a girl? You rogue!""
Thor reached out for Loki. He wanted to grab him. Tyr, the god of war, had to hold him back.

---

""Calm down,"" said Loki. ""It will just be for a few hours, until we get your hammer back. I will go with you. I will dress up and pretend to be your maid of honor.""
But Thor did not like this idea. ""Never!"" he roared. ""I will not do it!""
""Well,"" Loki said, ""does anyone else have a better plan?""
No one said anything.
At last, Odin's wife, Frigga, spoke. ""Loki's plan just might work,"" she said. ""It's our best chance.""
Frigga placed her lovely, white hand on Thor's massive shoulder. ""Thor,"" she said. ""I know you don't like the plan, but would you do it for me—and for Freya?""
Thor grumbled and groaned, but in the end he said yes.
""It's just for a few hours,"" Odin said, patting Thor on the back. ""A man can stand anything for a few hours.""

---

The gods sent a message to Thrym. Thrym wrote back. He said that the wedding would happen in eight days. Eight days later, the gods were working hard to get Thor ready.
""Pull!"" shouted Frigga.
""I'm pulling as hard as I can!"" replied Tyr.
Thor was barrel-chested and very strong. It was not easy fitting him into Freya's clothes. Tyr and Loki had already spent ten minutes trying to tighten the waist-strings on Freya's corset.
""Why did I let you fools talk me into this?"" said Thor.
""Take a deep breath,"" said Loki.
Thor took a breath. Then, Loki and Tyr began pulling on the corset strings.
""It's no use,"" said Tyr. ""We'll never make him look thin and dainty.""
""You're right,"" said Loki. ""Let's hope he's not too big to fit into Freya's dress!""

        When his wedding day came, Thrym was the happiest giant in all the land. He saw Freya's chariot coming toward his home. His heart beat fast with excitement. Thrym had loved Freya for many years. He never thought she would agree to marry him. Now his dream was coming true at last.
""Welcome, beautiful bride!"" Thrym called out with joy.
Thor and Loki stepped out of the chariot together. Thrym walked forward to greet his bride. He tried to give her a kiss, but Loki quickly pushed him away.
""Not yet!"" Loki said in his best girl voice. ""You must wait until after the wedding!""

---

Thrym led his guests to a big table for the wedding feast. Thor felt very hungry after the long trip. He ate a whole tray of small foods. Then he ate eight large salmon fish. He ate half of a huge ox that the servants had cooked. He drank three big barrels of sweet mead. When Thor finished eating, he let out a loud belch. ""Urrrrrrp!""
Thrym looked shocked. ""My goodness!"" he said. ""I have never seen a woman eat so much food or make such loud sounds!""
Loki saw they were in trouble. He had to think fast. ""Well, you see,"" Loki said quickly, ""Freya has been so excited to marry you that she could not eat anything. For eight whole days, she decided to fast and think only of you!""
""Oh!"" said Thrym. ""No wonder she is so hungry. Let her eat all she wants, my sweet love! Her waiting is almost over now.""

---

Thrym sat down next to his bride. He tried again to steal a kiss. He started to lift her veil, but he dropped it right away. ""Why do her eyes burn like angry fires?"" he asked with worry.
Smart Loki had another answer ready. ""That is because she has not slept for eight nights. She stayed awake the whole time, thinking only of you!""
""She is so thoughtful!"" said Thrym. ""I am sorry I kept you waiting so long, fair one!""
Loki quickly changed the subject. ""Is the wedding present ready?"" he asked.
""Yes, it is,"" said Thrym. ""I will go get it right now.""
When Thrym left, Thor growled under his veil. ""I will destroy that villain!""
""Be quiet!"" whispered Loki. ""We must wait until we have the hammer.""

---

Thrym came back carrying Thor's magic hammer. He placed it down right next to Thor.
""Ooo!"" said Thor in his girl voice. ""It's so big and heavy! May I touch it?""
""Of course, my beautiful bride,"" said Thrym with a smile.
""It pleases me very much,"" said Thor, still pretending to be a woman. Then he grabbed the hammer and lifted it high above his head. His wedding dress tore apart as he called out in his real voice like thunder, ""IT PLEASES ME GREATLY!""

        When his wedding day came, Thrym was the happiest giant in all the land. He saw Freya's chariot coming toward his home. His heart beat fast with excitement. Thrym had loved Freya for many years. He never thought she would agree to marry him. Now his dream was coming true at last.
""Welcome, beautiful bride!"" Thrym called out with joy.
Thor and Loki stepped out of the chariot together. Thrym walked forward to greet his bride. He tried to give her a kiss, but Loki quickly pushed him away.
""Not yet!"" Loki said in his best girl voice. ""You must wait until after the wedding!""

Thrym led his guests to a big table for the wedding feast. Thor felt very hungry after the long trip. He ate a whole tray of small foods. Then he ate eight large salmon fish. He ate half of a huge ox that the servants had cooked. He drank three big barrels of sweet mead. When Thor finished eating, he let out a loud belch. ""Urrrrrrp!""
Thrym looked shocked. ""My goodness!"" he said. ""I have never seen a woman eat so much food or make such loud sounds!""
Loki saw they were in trouble. He had to think fast. ""Well, you see,"" Loki said quickly, ""Freya has been so excited to marry you that she could not eat anything. For eight whole days, she decided to fast and think only of you!""
""Oh!"" said Thrym. ""No wonder she is so hungry. Let her eat all she wants, my sweet love! Her waiting is almost over now.""

---

Thrym sat down next to his bride. He tried again to steal a kiss. He started to lift her veil, but he dropped it right away. ""Why do her eyes burn like angry fires?"" he asked with worry.
Smart Loki had another answer ready. ""That is because she has not slept for eight nights. She stayed awake the whole time, thinking only of you!""
""She is so thoughtful!"" said Thrym. ""I am sorry I kept you waiting so long, fair one!""
Loki quickly changed the subject. ""Is the wedding present ready?"" he asked.
""Yes, it is,"" said Thrym. ""I will go get it right now.""
When Thrym left, Thor growled under his veil. ""I will destroy that villain!""
""Be quiet!"" whispered Loki. ""We must wait until we have the hammer.""

---

Thrym came back carrying Thor's magic hammer. He placed it down right next to Thor.
""Ooo!"" said Thor in his girl voice. ""It's so big and heavy! May I touch it?""
""Of course, my beautiful bride,"" said Thrym with a smile.
""It pleases me very much,"" said Thor, still pretending to be a woman. Then he grabbed the hammer and lifted it high above his head. His wedding dress tore apart as he called out in his real voice like thunder, ""IT PLEASES ME GREATLY!""

        When his wedding day came, Thrym was the happiest giant in all the land. He saw Freya's chariot coming toward his home. His heart beat fast with excitement. Thrym had loved Freya for many years. He never thought she would agree to marry him. Now his dream was coming true at last.
""Welcome, beautiful bride!"" Thrym called out with joy.
Thor and Loki stepped out of the chariot together. Thrym walked forward to greet his bride. He tried to give her a kiss, but Loki quickly pushed him away.
""Not yet!"" Loki said in his best girl voice. ""You must wait until after the wedding!""

---

Thrym led his guests to a big table for the wedding feast. Thor felt very hungry after the long trip. He ate a whole tray of small foods. Then he ate eight large salmon fish. He ate half of a huge ox that the servants had cooked. He drank three big barrels of sweet mead. When Thor finished eating, he let out a loud belch. ""Urrrrrrp!""
Thrym looked shocked. ""My goodness!"" he said. ""I have never seen a woman eat so much food or make such loud sounds!""
Loki saw they were in trouble. He had to think fast. ""Well, you see,"" Loki said quickly, ""Freya has been so excited to marry you that she could not eat anything. For eight whole days, she decided to fast and think only of you!""
""Oh!"" said Thrym. ""No wonder she is so hungry. Let her eat all she wants, my sweet love! Her waiting is almost over now.""

---

Thrym sat down next to his bride. He tried again to steal a kiss. He started to lift her veil, but he dropped it right away. ""Why do her eyes burn like angry fires?"" he asked with worry.
Smart Loki had another answer ready. ""That is because she has not slept for eight nights. She stayed awake the whole time, thinking only of you!""
""She is so thoughtful!"" said Thrym. ""I am sorry I kept you waiting so long, fair one!""
Loki quickly changed the subject. ""Is the wedding present ready?"" he asked.
""Yes, it is,"" said Thrym. ""I will go get it right now.""
When Thrym left, Thor growled under his veil. ""I will destroy that villain!""
""Be quiet!"" whispered Loki. ""We must wait until we have the hammer.""

---

Thrym came back carrying Thor's magic hammer. He placed it down right next to Thor.
""Ooo!"" said Thor in his girl voice. ""It's so big and heavy! May I touch it?""
""Of course, my beautiful bride,"" said Thrym with a smile.
""It pleases me very much,"" said Thor, still pretending to be a woman. Then he grabbed the hammer and lifted it high above his head. His wedding dress tore apart as he called out in his real voice like thunder, ""IT PLEASES ME GREATLY!""
Boom! Smash! Crash! Thor threw his mighty hammer in every direction. In just five minutes, Thrym and all his servants were dead on the ground.

        Balder was one of the sons of Odin and Frigga. He was the god that everyone loved most. Balder was beautiful, kind, and friendly. He always smiled, and when the other gods saw him, they smiled too. Everyone loved Balder—everyone except Loki.
One day, Loki saw that nobody was looking at him. They were all too busy watching Balder. Loki felt angry and jealous. He began to think about how he could get rid of Balder. He knew it would be hard because Balder's mother, Frigga, had worked to keep her son safe.
It all started many years ago when Balder was young. One night, Balder had a terrible dream. He dreamed about his own death. But the dream was not clear, and he could not tell how he died. He told his mother Frigga about the scary dream.

---

Frigga was frightened when she heard about the dream. She worried that it might be a sign of bad things to come. She loved her son and wanted to protect him. She went to Odin and told him about Balder's dream.
""Is Balder in danger?"" Frigga asked. ""I will look into it,"" Odin said. Odin sent his two ravens out to find answers. They came back with scary news. ""Hel, the goddess of the underworld, is getting ready,"" said one raven. ""She is preparing to receive one of the gods in the kingdom of the dead,"" said the other raven.
When Frigga heard this, she decided to take action. She would talk to everything in the world. She would make each thing promise to do no harm to her son Balder.

---

Frigga went everywhere. She spoke to the rocks and said, ""Promise me you will not hurt my son Balder."" The rocks promised they would not fall on him. She spoke to the water and made it promise not to drown Balder. Frigga kept going. She made all the animals swear to leave Balder alone. She spoke with all the trees as well.
Loki knew what Frigga had done. He knew that almost nothing could hurt Balder now. Many times he watched the gods play a game. They would throw rocks at Balder and watch them bounce off. Sometimes they shot arrows at him. The arrows broke into pieces and fell to the ground. The gods laughed and laughed, but Loki did not laugh.
""There must be something that will not bounce off him,"" Loki said. ""I will find out what it is.""

---

Loki decided to disguise himself as an old woman. He went to visit Frigga. ""Frigga,"" Loki said, ""I have heard a rumor. I heard that your son Balder is in danger. I am a mother too. I wanted to warn you, mother to mother.""
""Thank you,"" said Frigga, ""but you do not need to worry about Balder. I have spoken with everything that might hurt him. They have all promised not to harm him.""
""Has everything promised to do him no harm?"" Loki asked. ""Everything,"" said Frigga. ""Well, almost everything. When I was talking to the oak tree, I saw a little piece of mistletoe growing on it. I was going to ask it to promise not to hurt Balder, but I decided not to bother. What could mistletoe do to anyone? It is such a tiny plant! It does not even have its own roots. It grows on other trees and holds on to them, as helpless as a baby!""

It all started many years ago when Balder was young. One night, Balder had a terrible dream. He dreamed about his own death. But the dream was not clear, and he could not tell how he died. He told his mother Frigga about the scary dream.

---

Frigga was frightened when she heard about the dream. She worried that it might be a sign of bad things to come. She loved her son and wanted to protect him. She went to Odin and told him about Balder's dream.
""Is Balder in danger?"" Frigga asked. ""I will look into it,"" Odin said. Odin sent his two ravens out to find answers. They came back with scary news. ""Hel, the goddess of the underworld, is getting ready,"" said one raven. ""She is preparing to receive one of the gods in the kingdom of the dead,"" said the other raven.
When Frigga heard this, she decided to take action. She would talk to everything in the world. She would make each thing promise to do no harm to her son Balder.

---

Frigga went everywhere. She spoke to the rocks and said, ""Promise me you will not hurt my son Balder."" The rocks promised they would not fall on him. She spoke to the water and made it promise not to drown Balder. Frigga kept going. She made all the animals swear to leave Balder alone. She spoke with all the trees as well.
Loki knew what Frigga had done. He knew that almost nothing could hurt Balder now. Many times he watched the gods play a game. They would throw rocks at Balder and watch them bounce off. Sometimes they shot arrows at him. The arrows broke into pieces and fell to the ground. The gods laughed and laughed, but Loki did not laugh.
""There must be something that will not bounce off him,"" Loki said. ""I will find out what it is.""

---

Loki decided to disguise himself as an old woman. He went to visit Frigga. ""Frigga,"" Loki said, ""I have heard a rumor. I heard that your son Balder is in danger. I am a mother too. I wanted to warn you, mother to mother.""
""Thank you,"" said Frigga, ""but you do not need to worry about Balder. I have spoken with everything that might hurt him. They have all promised not to harm him.""
""Has everything promised to do him no harm?"" Loki asked. ""Everything,"" said Frigga. ""Well, almost everything. When I was talking to the oak tree, I saw a little piece of mistletoe growing on it. I was going to ask it to promise not to hurt Balder, but I decided not to bother. What could mistletoe do to anyone? It is such a tiny plant! It does not even have its own roots.

        Balder was one of the sons of Odin and Frigga. He was the god that everyone loved most. Balder was beautiful, kind, and friendly. He always smiled, and when the other gods saw him, they smiled too. Everyone loved Balder—everyone except Loki.
One day, Loki saw that nobody was looking at him. They were all too busy watching Balder. Loki felt angry and jealous. He began to think about how he could get rid of Balder. He knew it would be hard because Balder's mother, Frigga, had worked to keep her son safe.
It all started many years ago when Balder was young. One night, Balder had a terrible dream. He dreamed about his own death. But the dream was not clear, and he could not tell how he died. He told his mother Frigga about the scary dream.

---

Frigga was frightened when she heard about the dream. She worried that it might be a sign of bad things to come. She loved her son and wanted to protect him. She went to Odin and told him about Balder's dream.
""Is Balder in danger?"" Frigga asked. ""I will look into it,"" Odin said. Odin sent his two ravens out to find answers. They came back with scary news. ""Hel, the goddess of the underworld, is getting ready,"" said one raven. ""She is preparing to receive one of the gods in the kingdom of the dead,"" said the other raven.
When Frigga heard this, she decided to take action. She would talk to everything in the world. She would make each thing promise to do no harm to her son Balder.

---

Frigga went everywhere. She spoke to the rocks and said, ""Promise me you will not hurt my son Balder."" The rocks promised they would not fall on him. She spoke to the water and made it promise not to drown Balder. Frigga kept going. She made all the animals swear to leave Balder alone. She spoke with all the trees as well.
Loki knew what Frigga had done. He knew that almost nothing could hurt Balder now. Many times he watched the gods play a game. They would throw rocks at Balder and watch them bounce off. Sometimes they shot arrows at him. The arrows broke into pieces and fell to the ground. The gods laughed and laughed, but Loki did not laugh.
""There must be something that will not bounce off him,"" Loki said. ""I will find out what it is.""

---

Loki decided to disguise himself as an old woman. He went to visit Frigga. ""Frigga,"" Loki said, ""I have heard a rumor. I heard that your son Balder is in danger. I am a mother too. I wanted to warn you, mother to mother.""
""Thank you,"" said Frigga, ""but you do not need to worry about Balder. I have spoken with everything that might hurt him. They have all promised not to harm him.""
""Has everything promised to do him no harm?"" Loki asked. ""Everything,"" said Frigga. ""Well, almost everything. When I was talking to the oak tree, I saw a little piece of mistletoe growing on it. I was going to ask it to promise not to hurt Balder, but I decided not to bother. What could mistletoe do to anyone? It is such a tiny plant! It does not even have its own roots.

By including Frigga's conversation about the oak tree, the author reveals the critical flaw in her protection: she saw mistletoe but decided 'not to bother' asking it for a promise because it seemed too small and helpless.

        Balder was one of the sons of Odin and Frigga. He was the god that everyone loved most. Balder was beautiful, kind, and friendly. He always smiled, and when the other gods saw him, they smiled too. Everyone loved Balder—everyone except Loki.
One day, Loki saw that nobody was looking at him. They were all too busy watching Balder. Loki felt angry and jealous. He began to think about how he could get rid of Balder. He knew it would be hard because Balder's mother, Frigga, had worked to keep her son safe.
It all started many years ago when Balder was young. One night, Balder had a terrible dream. He dreamed about his own death. But the dream was not clear, and he could not tell how he died. He told his mother Frigga about the scary dream.

---

Frigga was frightened when she heard about the dream. She worried that it might be a sign of bad things to come. She loved her son and wanted to protect him. She went to Odin and told him about Balder's dream.
""Is Balder in danger?"" Frigga asked. ""I will look into it,"" Odin said. Odin sent his two ravens out to find answers. They came back with scary news. ""Hel, the goddess of the underworld, is getting ready,"" said one raven. ""She is preparing to receive one of the gods in the kingdom of the dead,"" said the other raven.
When Frigga heard this, she decided to take action. She would talk to everything in the world. She would make each thing promise to do no harm to her son Balder.

---

Frigga went everywhere. She spoke to the rocks and said, ""Promise me you will not hurt my son Balder."" The rocks promised they would not fall on him. She spoke to the water and made it promise not to drown Balder. Frigga kept going. She made all the animals swear to leave Balder alone. She spoke with all the trees as well.
Loki knew what Frigga had done. He knew that almost nothing could hurt Balder now. Many times he watched the gods play a game. They would throw rocks at Balder and watch them bounce off. Sometimes they shot arrows at him. The arrows broke into pieces and fell to the ground. The gods laughed and laughed, but Loki did not laugh.
""There must be something that will not bounce off him,"" Loki said. ""I will find out what it is.""

---

Loki decided to disguise himself as an old woman. He went to visit Frigga. ""Frigga,"" Loki said, ""I have heard a rumor. I heard that your son Balder is in danger. I am a mother too. I wanted to warn you, mother to mother.""
""Thank you,"" said Frigga, ""but you do not need to worry about Balder. I have spoken with everything that might hurt him. They have all promised not to harm him.""
""Has everything promised to do him no harm?"" Loki asked. ""Everything,"" said Frigga. ""Well, almost everything. When I was talking to the oak tree, I saw a little piece of mistletoe growing on it. I was going to ask it to promise not to hurt Balder, but I decided not to bother. What could mistletoe do to anyone? It is such a tiny plant! It does not even have its own roots.

""Hod,"" said Loki, ""why are you sitting there? Why don't you join the fun?"" Hod answered, ""Loki, you know I'm blind. How can I throw things at Balder when I can't see him?"" Loki took Hod by the hand. ""I will help you,"" he said. ""Put this arrow on the bow. I will point you the right way.""

Loki moved Hod into place and told him to shoot the arrow. The mistletoe arrow flew through the air and hit Balder in the chest. Balder fell to the ground. ""What happened?"" cried Hod. ""Did the arrow bounce off? Are you playing dead, brother?"" But Balder was not playing. He was really dead. Loki smiled an evil smile and sneaked away.

        Mistletoe was the only plant that had not promised to protect Balder. When Loki learned this, he went to get a piece of mistletoe. He cut the mistletoe into the shape of an arrow. Then he went to find Balder.
Loki found Balder and the other gods playing their favorite game. They were throwing things at Balder and laughing as the objects bounced away. But one god sat alone and did not play. It was Hod, one of Balder's brothers.
""Hod,"" said Loki, ""why are you sitting there? Why don't you join the fun?"" Hod answered, ""Loki, you know I'm blind. How can I throw things at Balder when I can't see him?"" Loki took Hod by the hand. ""I will help you,"" he said. ""Put this arrow on the bow. I will point you the right way.""

        Mistletoe was the only plant that had not promised to protect Balder. When Loki learned this, he went to get a piece of mistletoe. He cut the mistletoe into the shape of an arrow. Then he went to find Balder.
Loki found Balder and the other gods playing their favorite game. They were throwing things at Balder and laughing as the objects bounced away. But one god sat alone and did not play. It was Hod, one of Balder's brothers.
""Hod,"" said Loki, ""why are you sitting there? Why don't you join the fun?"" Hod answered, ""Loki, you know I'm blind. How can I throw things at Balder when I can't see him?"" Loki took Hod by the hand. ""I will help you,"" he said. ""Put this arrow on the bow. I will point you the right way.""

Loki moved Hod into place and told him to shoot the arrow. The mistletoe arrow flew through the air and hit Balder in the chest. Balder fell to the ground. ""What happened?"" cried Hod. ""Did the arrow bounce off? Are you playing dead, brother?"" But Balder was not playing. He was really dead. Loki smiled an evil smile and sneaked away.
When Frigga heard the news, she fell into despair. She cried and screamed. ""I will not let my son go to the underworld!"" she said. ""I will not let Hel have him!"" The gods sent Hermod, another of Balder's brothers, to talk to Hel. She was the goddess of the underworld. Odin let Hermod borrow his eight-legged steed, Sleipner. Hermod rode the horse to the underworld.

Hel told Hermod that the gods could have Balder back. But there was one rule. Every living thing in the world had to mourn for him. Hermod got on Sleipner and rode back to tell the gods. Odin sent word everywhere. All things must mourn for Balder.
In all the halls of Asgard, the gods began to mourn for Balder. Tyr went to Valhalla, where the bravest men from Earth lived. The Valkyries served food there. ""Warriors! Valkyries!"" Tyr called. ""Odin asks you to join us in mourning for Balder."" All the men on Earth mourned. The animals mourned. Even the plants mourned.

        Mistletoe was the only plant that had not promised to protect Balder. When Loki learned this, he went to get a piece of mistletoe. He cut the mistletoe into the shape of an arrow. Then he went to find Balder.
Loki found Balder and the other gods playing their favorite game. They were throwing things at Balder and laughing as the objects bounced away. But one god sat alone and did not play. It was Hod, one of Balder's brothers.
""Hod,"" said Loki, ""why are you sitting there? Why don't you join the fun?"" Hod answered, ""Loki, you know I'm blind. How can I throw things at Balder when I can't see him?"" Loki took Hod by the hand. ""I will help you,"" he said. ""Put this arrow on the bow. I will point you the right way.""

---

Loki moved Hod into place and told him to shoot the arrow. The mistletoe arrow flew through the air and hit Balder in the chest. Balder fell to the ground. ""What happened?"" cried Hod. ""Did the arrow bounce off? Are you playing dead, brother?"" But Balder was not playing. He was really dead. Loki smiled an evil smile and sneaked away.
When Frigga heard the news, she fell into despair. She cried and screamed. ""I will not let my son go to the underworld!"" she said. ""I will not let Hel have him!"" The gods sent Hermod, another of Balder's brothers, to talk to Hel. She was the goddess of the underworld. Odin let Hermod borrow his eight-legged steed, Sleipner. Hermod rode the horse to the underworld.

---

Hel told Hermod that the gods could have Balder back. But there was one rule. Every living thing in the world had to mourn for him. Hermod got on Sleipner and rode back to tell the gods. Odin sent word everywhere. All things must mourn for Balder.
In all the halls of Asgard, the gods began to mourn for Balder. Tyr went to Valhalla, where the bravest men from Earth lived. The Valkyries served food there. ""Warriors! Valkyries!"" Tyr called. ""Odin asks you to join us in mourning for Balder."" All the men on Earth mourned. The animals mourned. Even the plants mourned.

---

All things mourned for Balder except for one. Loki dressed up like an old woman and appeared before Hermod. ""Good day, old lady,"" said Hermod. ""Will you join us in weeping for Balder?"" ""I will not,"" said Loki. ""What do I care for Balder? Let Hel have him!""
That was it. The old woman had refused to mourn for Balder. Because of this, Hel would not let him return to the world of the living. The gods placed Balder in a boat. They set the boat on fire and pushed it out on the water. As the flames rose into the sky, Frigga wept for her lost child. Her tears flowed freely, but tears could not bring Balder back. Nothing could bring him back.",,,,,How does the author use the story's sections to show why the gods could not save Balder?,MCQ,Each section ranks the gods by their power and explains why weak gods failed,"Early sections set up Hel's rule, and later sections show one being refusing to follow it",The sections compare different underworlds and explain why Hel's was the strongest,Each section describes a different time period in Norse history from oldest to newest,B,"Incorrect. The story doesn't rank gods by power or blame 'weak gods' for failure. The sections show a chronological sequence where the plan failed not due to power levels but because Loki (disguised) deliberately refused to mourn, breaking Hel's requirement for universal mourning.","Correct! The author structures sections to build understanding: After Balder's death, the section about Hermod's journey establishes Hel's rule ('Every living thing in the world had to mourn'), the next section shows the widespread mourning attempt ('All things mourned for Balder'), and the final section reveals the failure ('except for one' - the old woman who refused). Each section builds on previous ones to explain the complete chain: rule established, attempt made, single violation, rescue failed. This structure shows how one refusal undermined the entire effort.","Incorrect. The story doesn't compare different underworlds or discuss their relative strength.

article_101074,Loki’s Punishment,test_quiz,5,quiz_302606_sibling_4,quiz,,"Loki disguised himself as a salmon. He swam in the rivers. The gods tried to catch him but Loki leaped out of their nets and escaped. At last, Thor caught him. He grabbed him in midair. Loki struggled, but Thor held him tight with his powerful hands.
The gods took Loki to a cavern deep underground. They chained him to the rocks. They took a serpent, whose mouth dripped with poison, and fastened it to the roof. A serpent is a large snake. Drops of poison fell out of the serpent's mouth and landed on Loki. Loki was in terrible pain. The poison dripped all night and all day. Each drop stung like a knife wound. Loki writhed in agony on the floor of the cave. Agony means the worst kind of pain you can imagine.

---

Loki went on suffering until his wife Siguna heard about his troubles. Loki had treated Siguna badly, but she still loved him. She left Asgard and went to live with Loki in the cavern. She stood next to her husband with a cup in her hand. She caught the drops of poison in the cup to keep them from falling on Loki. Loki still suffered, especially when Siguna had to empty the cup, but his pain was much less.
As Loki lay in the cavern, Siguna whispered to him and soothed him. She reminded him of stories they both knew about the future. These stories were called prophecies. A prophecy is a story that tells what will happen in the future. The prophecies told about Ragnarok and the fall of the gods.

---

""For now, we are beaten,"" she said. ""The gods in Asgard are happy about their triumph over you."" A triumph means a great victory. ""But they know that the day is coming. They have heard the prophecies. They know that the final battle of Ragnarok is coming.""
Siguna told Loki that when Ragnarok comes, terrible things will happen. The giants will rise and fight against the gods. Loki's son, Fenrir the Wolf, will break his chains and attack the gods. He will swallow up Odin himself. The mighty serpent Jormungand will do battle with Thor. None of the gods will escape their fate! Fate means what must happen to someone. All of them will die!

        Look up in the sky at noon. What do you see? If it is not cloudy, you will see the sun shining brightly in the sky. The sun gives us energy. This energy comes as light and heat. The sun's light and heat help plants and animals live. Without the sun, Earth would be freezing cold. Have you ever wondered what the sun is made of? Why does it give off so much light and heat?
You may be surprised to know that the sun is a star. It is the closest star to Earth. The sun is made up of very hot gases. How hot is it? A hot summer day on Earth might be 100 degrees. On the sun, it is 10,000 degrees! The sun stays that hot all the time. The sun's hot gases make the light and heat energy it gives off.

Long ago, people believed that the sun moved around Earth. This seemed to make sense to them. Each morning, the sun rose in the east. At the end of the day, the sun set in the west. To explain this change, people said the sun moved around Earth. But now we know that this is not what really happens. The sun does not move around Earth. It is Earth that moves around the sun!
The sun is in the center of a group of eight planets. All of these planets, including Earth, circle around the sun. When planets circle around the sun, we say they orbit the sun. The sun, planets, and other objects in space that orbit the sun are called the solar system. The word solar comes from the Latin word sol, which means ""the sun."" Everything in the solar system relates to the sun.

Our planet Earth moves in two ways. We have learned that Earth circles around the sun. It takes about 365 days for Earth to orbit the sun. That is one year! Earth also moves by spinning on its axis. An axis is like an invisible line that goes through the middle of Earth. When Earth spins on its axis, we say it rotates. Earth rotates once every day.
It is this spinning that makes day and night on Earth. As Earth rotates, different parts of it face the sun. When the part where you live faces the sun, it gets sunlight. Then it is daytime. The part that faces away from the sun gets no sunlight. On that side of Earth, it is nighttime. Did you know that when it is daytime where we live, it is nighttime on the other side of Earth?

---

When Earth rotates on its axis, it is tilted. This means Earth leans to one side like a spinning top that is falling over. At certain times of the year, one part of Earth is tilted toward the sun. The sunlight hits this part more directly and it feels hotter. For people living on this part of Earth, it is summer. For people living on the part of Earth tilted away from the sun, there is less sunlight and it is winter.So when it is summertime for us, there are people living on other parts of Earth where it is winter!

This conclusion synthesizes multiple ideas: the sun is central ('in the center'), planets orbit around it, the word 'solar' means sun, and Section 1 established the sun provides essential energy. Together, these support the conclusion that the sun's central position and energy make it the most important object.","Incorrect. While the text explains the Latin origin of 'solar,' this is just an etymological fact about the naming, not a conclusion about why everything relates to the sun. The statement is about the sun's importance, not just word origins.","Incorrect. The text never discusses the sun's movement speed or compares speeds of different objects. It states the sun is at the center while planets orbit around it - this is about position and relationship, not velocity.","Incorrect.

        Look up in the sky at noon. What do you see? If it is not cloudy, you will see the sun shining brightly in the sky. The sun gives us energy. This energy comes as light and heat. The sun's light and heat help plants and animals live. Without the sun, Earth would be freezing cold. Have you ever wondered what the sun is made of? Why does it give off so much light and heat?
You may be surprised to know that the sun is a star. It is the closest star to Earth. The sun is made up of very hot gases. How hot is it? A hot summer day on Earth might be 100 degrees. On the sun, it is 10,000 degrees! The sun stays that hot all the time. The sun's hot gases make the light and heat energy it gives off.

Long ago, people believed that the sun moved around Earth. This seemed to make sense to them. Each morning, the sun rose in the east. At the end of the day, the sun set in the west. To explain this change, people said the sun moved around Earth. But now we know that this is not what really happens. The sun does not move around Earth. It is Earth that moves around the sun!
The sun is in the center of a group of eight planets. All of these planets, including Earth, circle around the sun. When planets circle around the sun, we say they orbit the sun. The sun, planets, and other objects in space that orbit the sun are called the solar system. The word solar comes from the Latin word sol, which means ""the sun."" Everything in the solar system relates to the sun.

Our planet Earth moves in two ways. We have learned that Earth circles around the sun. It takes about 365 days for Earth to orbit the sun. That is one year! Earth also moves by spinning on its axis. An axis is like an invisible line that goes through the middle of Earth. When Earth spins on its axis, we say it rotates. Earth rotates once every day.
It is this spinning that makes day and night on Earth. As Earth rotates, different parts of it face the sun. When the part where you live faces the sun, it gets sunlight. Then it is daytime. The part that faces away from the sun gets no sunlight. On that side of Earth, it is nighttime. Did you know that when it is daytime where we live, it is nighttime on the other side of Earth?

---

When Earth rotates on its axis, it is tilted. This means Earth leans to one side like a spinning top that is falling over. At certain times of the year, one part of Earth is tilted toward the sun. The sunlight hits this part more directly and it feels hotter. For people living on this part of Earth, it is summer. For people living on the part of Earth tilted away from the sun, there is less sunlight and it is winter.So when it is summertime for us, there are people living on other parts of Earth where it is winter! The fact that Earth is tilted on its axis is what creates the seasons of the year. This is why we have spring, summer, fall, and winter.",,,,,What is the cause-and-effect relationship the text describes between Earth's rotation and what people on Earth experience?,MCQ,"Earth rotates toward the sun, which causes the sun to appear brighter at noon.","Earth rotates on its axis, which causes different parts to alternate between day and night.","Earth rotates around the sun, which causes the seasons to change throughout the year.","Earth rotates very quickly, which causes the sun to rise in the east each morning.",B,"Incorrect. Earth doesn't rotate toward the sun - it rotates on its axis while orbiting the sun. Also, the sun's brightness at noon isn't the main effect of rotation that the text emphasizes.

As Earth rotates, different parts of it face the sun. When the part where you live faces the sun, it gets sunlight. Then it is daytime.' Rotation directly causes the day-night alternation.","Incorrect. You're confusing rotation with orbit. Earth rotating (spinning) creates day and night, while orbiting (moving around the sun) combined with tilt creates seasons. Review the distinction between these two movements in Section 3.","Incorrect. While the sun does appear to rise in the east, this isn't framed as a cause-effect relationship with rotation.
