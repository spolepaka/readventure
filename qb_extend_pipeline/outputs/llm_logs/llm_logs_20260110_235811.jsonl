Or what if you couldn't see the world around you? Millions of people live with these challenges every day. Some people are deaf, which means they cannot hear well or at all. Other people are blind, which means they cannot see.\nPeople who are deaf have found special ways to talk with others. Many deaf people use American Sign Language. This is a way to communicate using hand movements instead of speaking. Each gesture or hand movement stands for a word or letter. When one person makes these signs, another person can watch and understand the message.\nDid you know there is a sign for every letter in the alphabet? You can spell your whole name using these hand signs! Some deaf people also learn to read lips. They watch how a person's mouth moves when they talk. Different sounds make your lips move in different ways. Try talking in a mirror and watch how your lips change shape!\n\n---\n\nNow think about what life would be like if you could not see. How would you walk around your house? How would you know where things are? People who are blind have learned amazing ways to live with their disability. They are overcoming this challenge in many clever ways.\nMany blind people use a white cane to help them move around safely. They tap the cane in front of them to feel for walls, steps, and other objects. Some blind people have a special helper called a guide dog. These dogs are trained to help their owners walk safely from place to place. The dogs can stop at curbs and avoid dangerous areas.\n\n---\n\nBlind people also use their other senses more than people who can see. They might recognize you by the sound of your voice or your footsteps. They can tell what food they are eating by how it smells and tastes.\nBlind people can also learn to read using a special system called Braille. In Braille, small raised bumps on paper stand for different letters. A blind person runs their fingers over these bumps and feels the patterns. Each pattern of bumps means a different letter. Then they put the letters together to make words, just like you do when you read!\nLearning sign language, reading lips, using a guide dog, or reading Braille takes lots of time and practice. But these amazing skills help people live full and happy lives, even when they cannot hear or see like others do.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.5 -

The passage establishes this cause/effect connection: deaf people 'cannot hear well or at all,' so 'People who are deaf have found special ways to talk with others' using American Sign Language (visual hand movements) and lip reading (watching mouth movements). Both solutions rely on vision instead of hearing.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This describes blind people, not deaf people. The passage clearly separates these two groups - deaf people cannot hear and use visual communication methods, while blind people cannot see and use Braille (raised bumps) to read.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This confuses solutions for deaf and blind people. Guide dogs help blind people navigate safely, not deaf people communicate. The passage explains deaf people use sign language and lip reading to overcome their hearing challenges.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The passage explains that blind people 'cannot see,' so naturally they rely on other senses. It states 'Blind people also use their other senses more than people who can see. They can tell what food they are eating by how it smells and tastes.' Their lack of vision creates the need to use other senses for information.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The passage does not suggest that using smell and taste increases hunger. It explains blind people use these senses to identify food because they cannot see it, not to stimulate their appetite.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Guide dogs help blind people walk safely and navigate, but the passage does not say guide dogs teach people to use their senses. The passage explains blind people naturally rely more on their other senses because they cannot see.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The purpose is demonstrating various adaptation methods through concrete examples.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The author presents both deafness and blindness with equal detail and respect, never suggesting one is harder than the other. The passage focuses on solutions people have developed, not comparing difficulty levels of different disabilities.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The passage explains how deaf and blind people use these tools, not arguing that all readers should learn them.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

While the passage mentions tools like guide dogs and white canes, the author emphasizes independence and capability. The tone is empowering, showing how people use tools to help themselves, not portraying them as constantly dependent on others.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The author's message is the opposite - the passage demonstrates all the things deaf and blind people CAN do through adaptation.

The author explicitly uses evaluative language: 'these amazing skills help people live full and happy lives.' The word choice 'amazing' reveals the author's admiring attitude toward both the skills and the people who learn them, showing respect and appreciation.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the author states learning 'takes lots of time and practice,' this is followed by positive language about how skills 'help people live full and happy lives.' The author acknowledges effort required but presents it positively, not as a discouragement.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The author describes hand movements in sign language factually and clearly, not as confusing. The explanation that 'each gesture or hand movement stands for a word or letter' shows the author presenting sign language as logical and learnable.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

This detail from the passage shows independence: blind people use tools (guide dogs, white canes) to navigate 'safely from place to place' on their own. The author's emphasis on these self-help tools reveals the belief that people with disabilities can function independently.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This contradicts the passage and the author's perspective. The passage explains deaf people communicate directly using sign language and lip reading, not that they need constant translation.
