# Math Raiders × Alpha School: Grade 4 Pilot

**Target:** Grade 4 students, Alpha School  
**Duration:** 10 instructional days (2 weeks)  
**Scope:** Multiplication and Division, 0–12 facts (target: 35 CQPM fluency standard)

---

## The Problem

AlphaMath Fluency provides sound pedagogy and proven fact sequences, but recent field data shows consistent engagement challenges *(Source: AlphaMath Fluency usage data across Alpha School network)*:

- Only **~50%** of students achieve daily practice targets
- **20–50%** waste time through idling, rushing, and distractions
- Wide variance in learning efficiency: **0.8 to 7+** minutes per fact

**The bottleneck:** Student engagement, not instructional design.

## The Proposal

Replace AlphaMath Fluency with Math Raiders for Grade 4 students during a 2-week pilot to test whether game-based mechanics solve the engagement gap.

**Hypothesis:** Cooperative team raids, immediate performance feedback, and visible progression drive higher daily practice volume, leading to faster mastery of Grade 4 multiplication and division facts.

## Pilot Structure

### Week 1

| Day | Activity | Duration |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Monday | AlphaMath pre-test, then intro raid | 5–8 min test<br>10–15 min practice |
| Tue–Fri | Math Raiders practice | 20 min/day |

### Week 2

| Day | Activity | Duration |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Mon–Thu | Math Raiders practice | 20 min/day |
| Friday | Warmup raid, then AlphaMath post-test | 10–12 min practice<br>5–8 min test |

**Total:** 170–180 minutes practice over 10 instructional days (~3 hours total)

## Grade 4 Scope

**Matches AlphaMath Fluency Grade 4 exactly** *(Verified via Timeback API, Oct 2025)*:

- **313** total facts (169 multiplication + 144 division)
- Target: **35 CQPM** (1.7-second threshold)
- Baseline: Students passed Grade 3 multiplication (**30 CQPM** on 0–9); 10–12 facts and division are new content

## The 2x Advantage

| Metric | AlphaMath Fluency | Math Raiders |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Daily practice | 10 min/day | 20 min/day |
| Total (10 days) | 100 min | 200 min |
| Learning efficiency | 4 min/fact | 3–4 min/fact |
| **Projected facts mastered** | **~25** | **~50–65** |

**2× more practice volume** drives proportional fact mastery gains *(AlphaMath planning: 10 min/day, 4 min/fact baseline; Math Raiders: 20 min/day, 3–4 min/fact target)*.

*Not claiming better pedagogy — just more engaged practice time.*

## Assessment & Success Criteria

### Assessment Method

Pre-test (Day 1): Students take AlphaMath Fluency Grade 4 assessment, establishing baseline CQPM for multiplication and division.

Post-test (Friday, Week 2): Same assessment (5–8 min) measures CQPM improvement from baseline.

### Success Criteria

**Tier 1 — Proves engagement value:**

- Average **16+** min/day among active participants (students with 5+ days) *(Benchmark: AlphaMath field data shows approximately half of students meeting daily practice targets)*

**Tier 2 — Proves learning outcomes:**

- Tier 1 AND **+5** or more CQPM improvement *(Based on RocketMath +3 CQPM/hour baseline; AlphaMath rate not yet established)*

**Tier 3 — Demonstrates superiority:**

- Tier 2 AND (Efficiency: **2.5–3.5** min/fact OR Outcomes: **+8–10** CQPM)

## Data & Reporting

**Automatic tracking:** Each raid logs practice time, facts mastered, and accuracy to Timeback.

**Weekly reports to Alpha:** Student engagement metrics, learning rates, and fact mastery progress.

**Student access:** Enrolled students launch Math Raiders directly from their Timeback course page.

## Timeline to Launch

**Next steps:**

1. Academics team approval
2. Alpha recruits Grade 4 volunteers
3. Alpha enrolls students in Math Raiders Grade 4 course (Timeback)
4. Pilot begins

**Duration:** Any consecutive 2-week period  
**Cohort:** Grade 4 volunteers
