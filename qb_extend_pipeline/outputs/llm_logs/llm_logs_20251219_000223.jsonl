He thought everything was perfect. But danger was coming. The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck.\"That lazy boy?\" the magician said. \"He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!\"The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, \"New lamps for old lamps!\"Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.\"I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,\" she thought.\n\n---\n\nThe princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.\"Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,\" the magician commanded. \"Move it to my home in North Africa.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.\"Find my daughter right now!\" the Sultan shouted. \"If you cannot bring her back, you will die!\"\n\n---\n\nPoor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.\"What do you wish?\" asked the genie of the ring.\"Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,\" Aladdin begged.\"I am sorry,\" said the genie. \"I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.\"\"Then please take me to be with my wife,\" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace. Aladdin and his wife made a plan to get the lamp back.\n\n---\n\nThe next day, the princess cooked a wonderful dinner for the magician. Aladdin hid so the magician could not see him. The princess put poison in the magician's cup. When the magician drank from the cup, he fell down and died.Aladdin ran into the room and looked for the lamp. He found it hidden in the magician's sleeve. Aladdin rubbed the lamp, and the huge genie appeared.\"What do you wish?\" the genie of the lamp asked in a loud voice.\"Take this palace with everything inside it,\" Aladdin commanded. \"Carry it back to Persia and put it next to the Sultan's home.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" the genie replied. The palace lifted up into the air and flew away.The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again! He ordered celebrations for a whole month. From that day on, Aladdin lived peacefully and safely with the princess. When the old Sultan died, Aladdin became the new ruler. He was fair and kind to all people, both rich and poor.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: Read the sentence.\"The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window.

This was the Cheshire Cat, and he had a huge grin on his face. Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.\"Cheshire Cat,\" Alice said politely, \"can you please tell me which way I should go from here?\"\"That depends on where you want to go,\" said the Cat with his big smile.\"I don't really care where I go,\" Alice replied.\"Then it doesn't matter which path you take,\" the Cat said back to her.\"I just want to get somewhere,\" Alice added quickly.\"Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,\" said the Cat.\n\n---\n\nAlice tried asking another question. \"What kind of people live around here?\"The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. \"Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.\"\"I don't want to visit crazy people,\" Alice said with worry.\"You can't help that here,\" said the Cat. \"Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!\"Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly. First his tail vanished, then his body, and finally everything was gone except his grin. The smile stayed floating in the air for a while after the rest of him had disappeared.\"How curious!\" Alice thought to herself. \"A grin without a cat! I have never seen anything like that before!\"\n\n---\n\nAlice continued walking until she came to a house. In front of the house was a large table set up for tea time. The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sitting at the table having tea. Between them sat a sleepy Dormouse. Even though the table was very big, all three of them were crowded together at just one corner.\"No room! No room!\" they shouted when they saw Alice coming toward them.\"There is plenty of room!\" Alice said angrily. She sat down in a big chair at the end of the table.\"Have some lemonade,\" the March Hare offered.Alice looked around the whole table carefully. \"I don't see any lemonade anywhere,\" she said.\"There isn't any lemonade,\" the March Hare replied.\"Then it was not very nice of you to offer it to me,\" Alice said with anger.\"It was not very nice of you to sit down when nobody invited you,\" the March Hare shot back.\n\n---\n\nThe Mad Hatter stared at Alice for a long time. Finally, he asked, \"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\"\"A riddle!\" Alice thought excitedly. \"This should be fun to solve!\"\"I think I can figure that out,\" she said out loud.\"Do you really think you know the answer?\" asked the March Hare.\"Yes, I do,\" said Alice confidently.\"Then you should say exactly what you mean,\" the March Hare continued.\"I do say what I mean. At least, I mean what I say. That's the same thing,\" Alice replied.\"Those are not the same thing at all!\" said the Mad Hatter. \"You might as well say that 'I see what I eat' means the same thing as 'I eat what I see!'\"The sleepy Dormouse added, \"You might as well say that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same as 'I sleep when I breathe!'\"The Mad Hatter turned back to Alice. \"Have you solved the riddle yet?\"\"No, I give up,\" Alice said. \"What is the answer?\"\"I have no idea,\" said the Mad Hatter.\"Neither do I,\" said the March Hare.Alice thought to herself, \"This is the strangest tea party I have ever been to in my whole life!\" She listened as the Dormouse told a very odd story about three sisters who lived at the bottom of a well made of syrup. Alice asked many questions because the story was so confusing. Finally, she got frustrated and walked away. \"That really was the strangest tea party ever!\" Alice concluded to herself as she left.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What does Alice do first when she arrives at the tea party?\n- A) She listens to the Dormouse tell a story about sisters.\n- B) She looks around the table for lemonade to drink.\n- C) She sits down in a big chair at the end of the table.\n- D) She asks the Mad Hatter to solve a riddle for her.\n- Correct: C\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty hard, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n- Question: What does the March Hare offer Alice, even though there isn't any?\n- A) A cup of tea\n- B) Lemonade\n- C) A plate of cookies\n- D) A big slice of cake\n- Correct: B\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 3, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.2.**\n\nDOK 3 Requirements for siblings:\n- Require strategic thinking and reasoning\n- Analyze, evaluate, or synthesize information\n- Draw conclusions based on multiple pieces of evidence\n- Make complex inferences or connections\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.7 - Explain how specific aspects of a text's illustrations contribute to what is conveyed by the words in a story (e.g., create mood, emphasize aspects of a character or setting).\n- Question: Read this outline about Alice's journey.

There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, \"Off with his head!\" and \"Off with her head!\" at everyone.\n\n---\n\nAlice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.\n\n---\n\nSuddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.\"Stuff and nonsense!\" Alice said loudly. \"The idea of having the sentence first!\" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. \"Hold your tongue!\" she yelled. \"I won't!\" Alice replied bravely. \"Off with her head!\" screamed the Queen.\n\n---\n\nJust at that moment, Alice woke up! She was lying on the river bank next to her sister. The sun was still shining brightly and it was a beautiful day. Alice was so excited to tell her sister about her amazing dream and all her adventures in Wonderland. Her sister enjoyed listening to all the wonderful stories.Alice's eyes sparkled as she told her sister about all the creatures she had met. She talked about the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the King and Queen of Hearts, and the White Rabbit. When Alice skipped away to have afternoon tea, her sister sat thinking about this magical world full of curious creatures. Alice's sister hoped that Alice would always remember her special dream about Wonderland and keep telling these amazing stories.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: How does Alice most likely feel when the Queen screams 'Off with her head!' at the trial?\n- A) confused\n- B) scared\n- C) brave\n- D) excited\n- Correct: C\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.\"What good is a book without pictures or talking?\" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!\n\n---\n\nAt first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!\" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.\n\n---\n\n\"Well!\" Alice thought to herself. \"After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!\"Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? \"I wonder how many miles I have fallen,\" Alice said out loud. \"I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.\"Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.\n\n---\n\nIn front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!\" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. \"That was not there before,\" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together. It was like cherry pie, custard, pineapple, turkey, candy, and buttered toast all at once. Alice drank it all up.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What causes Alice to follow the White Rabbit down the hole?\n- A) She wants to pick daisies.\n- B) She is bored sitting by the river.\n- C) The day is very hot.\n- D) The Rabbit pulls out a watch.\n- Correct: D\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty hard, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n- Question: What is the central message of this story about Alice's adventure?\n- A) When you're bored, something interesting will eventually happen.\n- B) You should always think carefully before making decisions.\n- C) When you are bored, you should look for something exciting to do.\n- D) Being curious can lead to amazing discoveries.\n- Correct: D\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 3, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.2.**\n\nDOK 3 Requirements for siblings:\n- Require strategic thinking and reasoning\n- Analyze, evaluate, or synthesize information\n- Draw conclusions based on multiple pieces of evidence\n- Make complex inferences or connections\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.5 - Refer to parts of stories, dramas, and poems when writing or speaking about a text, using terms such as chapter, scene, and stanza; describe how each successive part builds on earlier sections.\n- Question: Read this outline and complete the missing part.I.

The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.\"What a strange feeling!\" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.\n\n---\n\n\"I will eat this cake,\" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.\"How strange!\" cried Alice. \"Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!\" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.\n\n---\n\nThe White Rabbit was talking to himself. \"Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!\" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.\"Everything is so weird today!\" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!\"I wish I had not cried so much!\" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.\n\n---\n\nSoon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, \"Who are you?\" Alice felt confused. \"I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today.\" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important. \"One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.\" Alice broke off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: Alice and the White Rabbit both react in the same way when they have problems.

It's always a good time to visit Toad. Early in the morning or late at night, he's always the same friendly fellow. He's always happy to see you, and he's always sad when you have to leave!\"\"He must be a very nice animal,\" said Mole as he climbed into the boat.\"He really is the best of animals,\" Rat replied. \"He is so simple and so friendly. Maybe he's not very smart—we can't all be clever. He might be someone who brags a lot and thinks too highly of himself. But Toady is a great friend.\"\n\n---\n\nThey paddled around a bend in the river. Soon they could see a beautiful, grand old house. It was made of faded red brick. Well-kept green lawns stretched all the way down to the water's edge.\"There's Toad Hall,\" said Rat. \"Do you see that small creek on the left side? That goes to Toad's boathouse. That's where we'll leave our boat. The stables are over there. That big building you're looking at now is the banquet hall—it's very old. Toad has lots of money, you know. This is really one of the nicest houses around here. But we never tell Toad that!\"They paddled up the creek and moved into the shadow of a large boathouse. Inside, they saw many big boats. Some boats hung from wooden beams above them. Other boats were pulled up on ramps. But none of the boats were in the water. The whole place seemed empty and quiet.\n\n---\n\nRat looked around carefully. \"I see what's happening,\" he said. \"Boating is old news now. Toad got tired of it and stopped doing it. I wonder what new hobby he likes now. Come on, let's go see him. We'll hear all about it very soon.\"They stepped out of their boat and walked across the lawn covered with pretty flowers. They found Toad sitting in a wicker garden chair. He had a large map spread out across his knees.\"Hooray!\" Toad cried out, jumping up when he saw them. \"This is wonderful!\" He shook both of their paws warmly. He didn't even wait for Rat to introduce Mole to him. \"How nice of you to come!\" he said, dancing around them in circles. \"I was just about to send a boat down the river to get you, Ratty. I had orders ready that you must come here right away, no matter what you were doing. You don't know how lucky this is that you showed up right now!\"\"What a lovely house you have!\" said Mole.\"It's the finest house on the whole river,\" cried Toad proudly. \"Or anywhere else, really,\" he couldn't help but add.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RL.3.1 - Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n- Question: Which body of water is the main setting of the story?\n- A) a river\n- B) the ocean\n- C) a lake\n- D) a pond\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty easy, CCSS RL.3.1.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: Based on his words and actions in the story, Toad most likely feels\n- A) proud.\n- B) lonely.\n- C) insecure.\n- D) worried.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 3, difficulty hard, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 3 Requirements for siblings:\n- Require strategic thinking and reasoning\n- Analyze, evaluate, or synthesize information\n- Draw conclusions based on multiple pieces of evidence\n- Make complex inferences or connections\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.\n- Question: Read the sentence from the passage. \"Maybe he's not very smart—we can't all be clever.

We can see dusty highways and visit camps, villages, towns, and cities! Today we are here, but tomorrow we can go somewhere else! We can travel to new places and have fun!

He made an angry sound and put his hands in his pockets.\n\n---\n\nInside the wagon were small beds and a table that could fold against the wall. There was a cooking stove, storage boxes, and bookshelves. Toad even had a birdcage with a bird inside. The wagon had pots, pans, and kettles of every size.\"Everything is ready!\" said Toad happily. \"We have everything we need to start our trip this afternoon.\"\"Wait a minute,\" said Rat. \"Did you say 'WE' and 'STARTING' and 'THIS AFTERNOON'?\"\"Yes!

Mole is going to stay with me too. Right, Mole?\"\"Of course I'll stick with you, Rat,\" said Mole. He was loyal to his friend. \"I'll do whatever you say. But it does sound like it might be fun,\" he added quietly.Poor Mole! He had never been on a big adventure before. It sounded very exciting and tempting. He really liked the pretty yellow wagon.Rat could see that Mole wanted to go. Rat didn't like to disappoint people, and he really cared about Mole.

The food was always good there. During the meal, Toad talked to Mole about taking a trip. Toad was very good at talking people into things. He told Mole all about the fun they would have on the open road. He made it sound like the best thing in the world. Mole got so excited that he could hardly sit still in his chair. In the end, Rat let Toad and Mole change his mind. He did not want to disappoint his friends. So after lunch, they loaded up the wagon and set off on their adventure.\n\n---\n\nIt was a beautiful golden afternoon. The dust from the road smelled rich and good. Birds sang to them from the thick fruit trees on both sides of the road. Other travelers called out \"Good day!\" to them. Some people stopped to say nice things about their beautiful wagon.\"Ah,\" said Toad, stretching out his legs. \"This is the real life for a gentleman!\" They had a pleasant trip along the narrow country roads. Everything was going well until they reached the big highway. That is where disaster struck them.\n\n---\n\nThey were walking along the highway when they saw a small cloud of dust. It was coming toward them very fast. From the dust cloud, they heard a faint \"toot-toot!\" It sounded like an animal in pain. They turned to keep talking to each other. But in just one moment, everything changed completely. With a big blast of wind and a whirl of loud sound, it was right on top of them! They had to jump into the nearest ditch to get out of the way.\n\n---\n\nThe horn of the motor car rang out loudly, \"TOOT-TOOT!\" They got a quick look inside the car. It had shiny glass and beautiful leather seats. Then the amazing motor car threw a huge cloud of dust that made it hard for them to see. The car got smaller and smaller as it drove away into the distance.The old grey horse got scared and jumped forward. Then there was a terrible crash. Their beautiful yellow wagon fell over on its side in the ditch. Rat was very angry.

He was sitting in the middle of the dusty road. He stared at the motor car as it drove away. Toad went into a kind of dream. His face looked calm and peaceful. He said quietly, \"toot-toot!\" Rat shook him by the shoulder, but Toad did not move at all.\"What a beautiful sight!\" Toad said softly. \"That is the REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel! Oh my! Oh my! I must get one!\" Mole tapped Rat on the shoulder, but Toad kept talking.\"I can't believe I never KNEW about this!\" he said. \"All those years are wasted now. I never knew about motor cars. I never even dreamed about them! But NOW I know. Oh, what fun I will have! What dust clouds will form behind me when I speed down the road! What wagons I will push into the ditch! Those awful little wagons, common wagons, yellow-colored wagons!\"\n\n---\n\n\"What should we do with him?\" asked Mole. \"There is nothing we can do,\" said Rat. \"He has gone mad. He has got a new idea stuck in his head. It is always like this when he starts something new. He will go on like that for days now. He will walk around in a happy dream. He won't be able to do anything useful. Never mind him. Let's go see what we can do about the wagon.\"They looked at the wagon carefully. They found that it would not work anymore. One wheel had been broken into many pieces. \"Come on!\" said Rat. \"We will have to walk. It is five or six miles to the nearest town. The sooner we start walking, the better.\"\"But what about Toad?\" asked Mole. \"We can't leave him here sitting in the middle of the road by himself! It's not safe. What if another motor car comes along?\" \"Never mind him,\" said Rat. \"I'm done with him!\"\n\n---\n\nThey had not walked very far when they heard footsteps behind them. Toad caught up with them. He put his paw inside each of their arms. \"Now, look here Toad!\" said Rat in a sharp voice. \"As soon as we get to the town, you must go straight to the police station. You must see if they know anything about that motor car. You must find out who owns it. You must complain because your wagon is broken. Then, you must go to a blacksmith so he can fix the wagon. Meanwhile, Mole and I will find rooms where we can stay until the wagon is ready.\"\"Police station? Complain?\" said Toad in a dreamy voice. \"Why would I complain about that beautiful motor car? I am done with wagons forever. I never want to see that wagon again or hear about it. Oh, Ratty!\" The animals spent the night in town. The next day, Rat and Mole made their way back to the river bank.\n\n---\n\nA few days later, Mole was sitting on the bank fishing. Rat walked up to him. \"Have you heard the news?\" Rat asked. \"Everyone is talking about it. Toad went to town on the train this morning. He has ordered a large and very expensive motor car.\"\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.1 - Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n- Question: Based on what happened in the story, where should Rat and Mole look the next time they want to find Toad?\n- A) sitting in the middle of the road\n- B) at a motor car dealer in town\n- C) walking along the river bank\n- D) at the police station complaining\n- Correct: B\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.1.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 -

Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?\nAll living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.\n\n---\n\nPlants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.\nAnimals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.\n\n---\n\nPlants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.\nScientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.\n\n---\n\nWe classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!\nThat's all for now! Rattenborough, over and out! I will be back in the next chapter to tell you more about how animals are sorted into different groups.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.4 -
