        Where was Toad? He was sitting in the middle of the dusty road. He stared at the motor car as it drove away. Toad went into a kind of dream. His face looked calm and peaceful. He said quietly, ""toot-toot!"" Rat shook him by the shoulder, but Toad did not move at all.""What a beautiful sight!"" Toad said softly. ""That is the REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel!

I never knew about motor cars. I never even dreamed about them! But NOW I know. Oh, what fun I will have! What dust clouds will form behind me when I speed down the road! What wagons I will push into the ditch! Those awful little wagons, common wagons, yellow-colored wagons!""

""What should we do with him?"" asked Mole. ""There is nothing we can do,"" said Rat. ""He has gone mad. He has got a new idea stuck in his head. It is always like this when he starts something new.

They had not walked very far when they heard footsteps behind them. Toad caught up with them. He put his paw inside each of their arms. ""Now, look here Toad!"" said Rat in a sharp voice. ""As soon as we get to the town, you must go straight to the police station. You must see if they know anything about that motor car. You must find out who owns it.

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

---

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

---

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!

This means they change to fit better in their home.

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals.

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals.

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

---

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

---

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!
That's all for now! Rattenborough, over and out! I will be back in the next chapter to tell you more about how animals are sorted into different groups.",,,,,What does the relationship between sections 3 and 4 suggest about the classification of animals?,MCQ,Classification is complete because scientists have sorted all known animals,Classification is ongoing work as scientists discover more animals to study,Classification only applies to animals that live in cold snowy places,Classification is impossible because there are too many types of insects,B,"Good try!

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals. Most crocodiles only eat once a week, but they can live for months without eating!",,,,,Which phrase best describes the main topic of this article?,MCQ,where different animals live,how scientists group animals,why animals need water,when animals eat food,B,"Good try!

When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! Scientists who study animals put them into different groups. They look at many things about animals. Some scientists check if animals have hair or scales on their skin. They see if animals have live babies or lay eggs. They also check if mothers feed milk to their babies. Scientists want to know if animals are warm-blooded or cold-blooded too.
One very important thing scientists study is the animal's backbone. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Humans are vertebrates too! Put your hand on the back of your neck. Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.

---

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

---

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.
Some very interesting invertebrates live in the sea. Lobsters, shrimp, and crabs do not have a backbone. The giant octopus is an invertebrate as well. Have you ever seen a jellyfish or a starfish? They are also invertebrates. All of these animals do not have a backbone or spinal cord.",,,,,Why do scientists study whether animals have a backbone?,MCQ,Scientists use backbones to group animals into categories.,Scientists want to see which animals are the biggest.,Scientists need to count how many bones animals have.,Scientists want to know how fast animals can run.,A,"Great job!

Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.
Some very interesting invertebrates live in the sea. Lobsters, shrimp, and crabs do not have a backbone. The giant octopus is an invertebrate as well. Have you ever seen a jellyfish or a starfish? They are also invertebrates. All of these animals do not have a backbone or spinal cord.",,,,,The paragraph that begins with 'Your backbone or spine does an important job' is mainly about,MCQ,why scientists study backbones,where backbones are found,what the backbone does,how to feel your backbone,C,"Good try!

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! Scientists who study animals put them into different groups. They look at many things about animals. Some scientists check if animals have hair or scales on their skin. They see if animals have live babies or lay eggs. They also check if mothers feed milk to their babies. Scientists want to know if animals are warm-blooded or cold-blooded too.
One very important thing scientists study is the animal's backbone. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Humans are vertebrates too! Put your hand on the back of your neck.

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.
Along the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first. Salmon happen to be one of the tastiest fish of all!",,,,,Which fact about salmon is clear from the information in the passage?,MCQ,Salmon are the only fish that travel in schools.,Salmon live only in fresh water their whole lives.,Salmon return to the same stream where they were born.,Salmon use maps to find their way home.,C,"Good try!

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.
Along the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first. Salmon happen to be one of the tastiest fish of all!",,,,,"The passage organizes information about salmon by first explaining where they live, then describing",MCQ,what they look like and how big they grow,how they find their way back home,why they are the tastiest fish,when they first developed gills,B,"Good try!

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.
Along the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first. Salmon happen to be one of the tastiest fish of all!",,,,,"When using text features to research multiple aspects of fish, a student should",MCQ,memorize all the bold words before reading any sections,identify bold words related to their specific research questions,write down every bold word in alphabetical order,read sections without bold words first to get background,B,Good try!

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

---

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.
A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water. Now you can see why the Latin meaning of amphibian makes perfect sense!",,,,,"According to the passage, the changes in a tadpole's body help it",MCQ,swim faster,hide better,eat more,live on land,D,"Good try!

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

---

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.
A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.
A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water. Now you can see why the Latin meaning of amphibian makes perfect sense!",,,,,A reader looking for information about what amphibians eat should read,MCQ,the beginning of Section 1 about amphibian classification,the middle of Section 3 describing tadpole eating habits,the end of Section 5 explaining adult carnivore diets,the start of Section 2 about toad life cycles,C,"Good try!

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

---

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

---

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.
Crocodiles have the most powerful bite of all animals. Their bites are ten times stronger than a great white shark's bite. But it is easy to hold a crocodile's mouth closed because they use weak muscles to open their mouths. Even a third grader might be able to hold a crocodile's jaw shut!",,,,,The author of this passage would most likely agree that,MCQ,All reptiles are dangerous and should be avoided.,Most reptiles are not harmful to people.,Snakes are the only reptiles worth studying.,People should never go near any reptile.,B,"Good try!

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.

        Hello! It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.
Birds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.

---

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

---

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

---

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.

        Hello! It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.
Birds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.

        Hello! It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.
Birds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.

---

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

---

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

---

Mammals come in many different shapes and sizes. Some swim in oceans, some fly in the sky, and some walk on land. But all mammals share the same basic things - they have hair, backbones, make milk for their babies, and are warm-blooded. These characteristics help scientists know that an animal is a mammal, no matter how different it might look!",,,,,What is the purpose of this passage?,MCQ,to explain what makes an animal a mammal,to compare mammals to fish and birds,to teach readers how to take care of pet mammals,to tell stories about ocean animals,A,"Great job! You found the main idea by seeing that the story asks ""Do you know what makes an animal a mammal?"" The whole passage explains mammal traits like hair, milk, and breathing air.","Good try!

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

---

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows? Maybe you will be the first to find a feathered fish or a flying snail. It may sound silly now, but a hundred years ago, nobody knew that whales talked to each other.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

---

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows?

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

---

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows? Maybe you will be the first to find a feathered fish or a flying snail. It may sound silly now, but a hundred years ago, nobody knew that whales talked to each other. What will you discover?",,,,,How does the author support the main idea that zoologists contribute to our understanding of animals?,MCQ,By comparing warm-blooded animals to cold-blooded animals in detail.,"By providing examples of discoveries like organs, groupings, and new species.",By explaining the meaning of difficult vocabulary words throughout the passage.,By describing Aristotle's book called A History of Animals from long ago.,B,"Good try!

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

---

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.
She loves working with young people and teaching them how to protect animals. She has written many books and has won many awards for her work. Even when she was 79 years old, she was still working to spread the message that animals need our protection!",,,,,Someone might read this passage to,MCQ,persuade others to protect animals.,learn facts about Jane Goodall.,enjoy a story about chimpanzees.,learn how to become a scientist.,B,Good try!

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.
She loves working with young people and teaching them how to protect animals. She has written many books and has won many awards for her work.

Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.

        Oceans are very deep bodies of water. People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.
The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

---

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

---

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

        Oceans are very deep bodies of water. People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.
The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

---

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

        Oceans are very deep bodies of water. People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.
The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

---

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

---

Like other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it. Their favorite spot is on a tree branch that has fallen into a pond. Tree frogs have been around for a very long time. They lived on Earth even before dinosaurs! You can find different types of tree frogs in North America, South America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

---

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

Like other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

---

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

Like other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it.

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

---

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

---

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

---

You never want a Komodo dragon to bite you or even lick you! Their saliva is full of dangerous germs that can make people very sick. The saliva in their mouth contains bacteria that can be deadly.

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

---

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

---

One beaver family can change the land around them in big ways. Their dams make the water in rivers rise higher. This floods the land nearby and creates a swamp called a wetland. A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.
Beavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave.

After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

        Birds live all around the world. They come in many sizes and colors. Some birds are very big, and some are very small. Hummingbirds are some of the smallest birds on Earth. The bee hummingbird is only two inches long. It weighs less than a penny!
Hummingbirds are amazing little animals. They can flap their wings up to 90 times in one second. That is so fast that their wings look like a blur. It is hard to see their wings because they move so quickly. These tiny birds can hover in the air like a helicopter. They can also fly backwards and upside-down. No other birds can do this!

---

Hummingbirds fly from flower to flower like busy bees. They use their long, pointy beaks to drink sweet nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sugary liquid that gives them lots of energy. Since they flap their wings so much, they need to eat a lot of food. A hummingbird will visit hundreds of flowers every day. It drinks more than its own weight in nectar! They also eat small insects they find on the flowers.
These birds love red flowers the most. People hang red feeders filled with sugary water to attract them. The feeders are dyed red because hummingbirds are drawn to this bright color. Many people enjoy watching these fast little birds at their feeders.

---

Many hummingbirds migrate to different places during the year. The ruby-throated hummingbird lives in the eastern United States during spring and summer. When autumn comes, it flies south to warmer places. This tiny bird makes an incredible journey. It flies 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico without stopping! From there, it may continue south through Mexico to Costa Rica and other countries.
Hummingbird nests are very small. They are about half the size of a walnut shell. The birds make their nests using tiny pieces of moss and leaves. They use spider webs to hold everything together. The spider web works like glue because it is sticky. It is also flexible, which means it can stretch and bend.

A hummingbird lays two tiny eggs in its nest. When the babies hatch and start to grow, the spider web stretches to make the nest bigger. This helps keep the babies warm and safe as they get larger.

        Birds live all around the world. They come in many sizes and colors. Some birds are very big, and some are very small. Hummingbirds are some of the smallest birds on Earth. The bee hummingbird is only two inches long. It weighs less than a penny!
Hummingbirds are amazing little animals. They can flap their wings up to 90 times in one second. That is so fast that their wings look like a blur. It is hard to see their wings because they move so quickly. These tiny birds can hover in the air like a helicopter. They can also fly backwards and upside-down. No other birds can do this!

Hummingbirds fly from flower to flower like busy bees. They use their long, pointy beaks to drink sweet nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sugary liquid that gives them lots of energy. Since they flap their wings so much, they need to eat a lot of food. A hummingbird will visit hundreds of flowers every day. It drinks more than its own weight in nectar! They also eat small insects they find on the flowers.
These birds love red flowers the most. People hang red feeders filled with sugary water to attract them. The feeders are dyed red because hummingbirds are drawn to this bright color. Many people enjoy watching these fast little birds at their feeders.

Many hummingbirds migrate to different places during the year. The ruby-throated hummingbird lives in the eastern United States during spring and summer. When autumn comes, it flies south to warmer places. This tiny bird makes an incredible journey. It flies 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico without stopping! From there, it may continue south through Mexico to Costa Rica and other countries.
Hummingbird nests are very small. They are about half the size of a walnut shell. The birds make their nests using tiny pieces of moss and leaves. They use spider webs to hold everything together. The spider web works like glue because it is sticky. It is also flexible, which means it can stretch and bend.

From there, it may continue south through Mexico to Costa Rica and other countries.
Hummingbird nests are very small. They are about half the size of a walnut shell. The birds make their nests using tiny pieces of moss and leaves. They use spider webs to hold everything together. The spider web works like glue because it is sticky. It is also flexible, which means it can stretch and bend.

A hummingbird lays two tiny eggs in its nest. When the babies hatch and start to grow, the spider web stretches to make the nest bigger. This helps keep the babies warm and safe as they get larger. The mother bird feeds her babies insects and sweet nectar.

        Birds live all around the world. They come in many sizes and colors. Some birds are very big, and some are very small. Hummingbirds are some of the smallest birds on Earth. The bee hummingbird is only two inches long. It weighs less than a penny!
Hummingbirds are amazing little animals. They can flap their wings up to 90 times in one second. That is so fast that their wings look like a blur. It is hard to see their wings because they move so quickly. These tiny birds can hover in the air like a helicopter. They can also fly backwards and upside-down. No other birds can do this!

Hummingbirds fly from flower to flower like busy bees. They use their long, pointy beaks to drink sweet nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sugary liquid that gives them lots of energy. Since they flap their wings so much, they need to eat a lot of food. A hummingbird will visit hundreds of flowers every day. It drinks more than its own weight in nectar! They also eat small insects they find on the flowers.
These birds love red flowers the most. People hang red feeders filled with sugary water to attract them. The feeders are dyed red because hummingbirds are drawn to this bright color. Many people enjoy watching these fast little birds at their feeders.

These birds love red flowers the most. People hang red feeders filled with sugary water to attract them. The feeders are dyed red because hummingbirds are drawn to this bright color. Many people enjoy watching these fast little birds at their feeders.

---

Many hummingbirds migrate to different places during the year. The ruby-throated hummingbird lives in the eastern United States during spring and summer. When autumn comes, it flies south to warmer places. This tiny bird makes an incredible journey. It flies 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico without stopping! From there, it may continue south through Mexico to Costa Rica and other countries.
Hummingbird nests are very small. They are about half the size of a walnut shell. The birds make their nests using tiny pieces of moss and leaves. They use spider webs to hold everything together. The spider web works like glue because it is sticky. It is also flexible, which means it can stretch and bend.

---

A hummingbird lays two tiny eggs in its nest. When the babies hatch and start to grow, the spider web stretches to make the nest bigger. This helps keep the babies warm and safe as they get larger. The mother bird feeds her babies insects and sweet nectar. These amazing little birds are some of the most interesting creatures you can find!",,,,,"According to Section 3, what is the relationship between the spider web stretching and the baby birds staying safe?",MCQ,The stretching web makes noise that warns babies of danger nearby.,The stretching web creates more space so babies remain warm and protected.,The stretching web attracts the mother bird back to feed the babies.,The stretching web signals to other birds that the nest is occupied.,B,Good try!

        Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. Some of you may remember me from when you were in first grade. I came to your school to teach you about your body. I told you to eat healthy food so you would grow big and strong. It looks like you listened! You have grown so much since then!
Today I am here to teach you more about your body and how it works. We will learn about three important systems. These are the skeletal system, the muscular system, and the nervous system. Each system has a special job to help your body work.

---

Let's start with the skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of all the bones in your body. These bones give your body its shape. I have pictures on my computer to show you. You have more than 200 bones in your body! When I went to medical school, I had to learn the name of every single bone. That was very hard work!
Let's begin at the top with your skull. Doctors also call the skull the cranium. Your skull has a very important job. It protects your brain, which is a soft organ inside your head. You might think your skull is one big bone, but it's not! Your skull is actually made of 22 different bones that fit together.

---

Now rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone there? That is part of your spine. Your spine is made of more than thirty small bones stacked on top of each other. Each small bone is called a vertebra. All these bones together protect your spinal cord, which sends messages to your brain.
If you tap on your chest, you can feel your breastbone. The medical name for this bone is the sternum. If you tap to the left or right, you might feel your ribs. Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs. The ribs look like a cage around these organs. Behind your ribs are two bones shaped like a triangle. These are your shoulder blade bones. The medical name for shoulder blade is scapula.

---

The pelvis is the group of bones at your hips. In your lower leg, you have two important bones. The tibia is the bigger bone, and the fibula is the smaller one next to it.
Now let's play Simon Says to practice these bone names! When you take a deep breath, watch how your rib cage can expand to make room for air. Your skeletal system works with your muscular system and nervous system to help you move and stay healthy. Are you ready to play?
Simon says, tap your skull! Simon says, now tap your cranium! Did I trick you? They are the same bone! Simon says, bend over and touch your tibia. Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your ribs expand. Now touch your scapula! Wait - I didn't say Simon says!",,,,,"According to the text, what does Dr. Welbody say is needed to protect your brain?",MCQ,soft organ inside your head,twenty-two bones that fit together,more than thirty small bones,bones shaped like a triangle,B,"Good try! The brain is ""a soft organ inside your head,"" but that's what needs protection. The story says your skull is made of ""22 different bones that fit together"" to protect your brain.","Great job!

Let's start with the skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of all the bones in your body. These bones give your body its shape. I have pictures on my computer to show you. You have more than 200 bones in your body! When I went to medical school, I had to learn the name of every single bone. That was very hard work!
Let's begin at the top with your skull. Doctors also call the skull the cranium. Your skull has a very important job. It protects your brain, which is a soft organ inside your head. You might think your skull is one big bone, but it's not! Your skull is actually made of 22 different bones that fit together.

---

Now rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone there? That is part of your spine. Your spine is made of more than thirty small bones stacked on top of each other. Each small bone is called a vertebra. All these bones together protect your spinal cord, which sends messages to your brain.
If you tap on your chest, you can feel your breastbone. The medical name for this bone is the sternum. If you tap to the left or right, you might feel your ribs. Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs. The ribs look like a cage around these organs. Behind your ribs are two bones shaped like a triangle. These are your shoulder blade bones. The medical name for shoulder blade is scapula.

---

The pelvis is the group of bones at your hips. In your lower leg, you have two important bones. The tibia is the bigger bone, and the fibula is the smaller one next to it.
Now let's play Simon Says to practice these bone names! When you take a deep breath, watch how your rib cage can expand to make room for air. Your skeletal system works with your muscular system and nervous system to help you move and stay healthy. Are you ready to play?
Simon says, tap your skull! Simon says, now tap your cranium! Did I trick you? They are the same bone! Simon says, bend over and touch your tibia. Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your ribs expand. Now touch your scapula! Wait - I didn't say Simon says!",,,,,Dr. Welbody mentions playing Simon Says to practice bone names. What does this activity reveal about how she wants students to learn?,MCQ,She believes students learn best when they can move their bodies and interact with the content physically,She thinks students need to be tricked into learning by disguising lessons as games,She wants to show that skeletal system knowledge is only useful during game activities,She prefers that students focus on following directions rather than understanding concepts,A,"Exactly! Dr. Welbody has students touch their bones and ""play Simon Says to practice these bone names"" while moving. She knows kids learn better when they use their bodies!","Not quite! Dr. Welbody tells the students exactly what they're doing - she's not hiding the learning. She wants to make learning fun, not trick them.","Good try, but the story shows bones do important jobs like protecting your brain and helping you move. The game is just one way to practice what she taught.","Close! While Simon Says has directions, Dr. Welbody really wants kids to understand their bones. She teaches about bones first, then uses the game to practice.",3,easy,RI.3.1,3,quiz_302216,2026-01-10T19:58:15.118590,Targets end section analyzing Dr. Welbody's pedagogical philosophy through Simon Says - differs from reference by asking WHY she uses games (teaching philosophy) vs WHAT the game accomplishes (outcome). Requires deeper inference about teaching beliefs.,,all choices are beliefs or teaching philosophies about learning,all describe potential educational perspectives or values,"A: 17 words, B: 14 words, C: 14 words, D: 13 words - balanced within 24%","each represents different teaching philosophy: kinesthetic learning, deceptive pedagogy, limited application, procedural focus",only A is defensible based on consistent physical engagement throughout text,targets teaching philosophy analysis - completely different from reference asking about game's practical function,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,extended,,,,

        Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. Some of you may remember me from when you were in first grade. I came to your school to teach you about your body. I told you to eat healthy food so you would grow big and strong. It looks like you listened! You have grown so much since then!
Today I am here to teach you more about your body and how it works. We will learn about three important systems. These are the skeletal system, the muscular system, and the nervous system. Each system has a special job to help your body work.

---

Let's start with the skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of all the bones in your body. These bones give your body its shape. I have pictures on my computer to show you. You have more than 200 bones in your body! When I went to medical school, I had to learn the name of every single bone. That was very hard work!
Let's begin at the top with your skull. Doctors also call the skull the cranium. Your skull has a very important job. It protects your brain, which is a soft organ inside your head. You might think your skull is one big bone, but it's not! Your skull is actually made of 22 different bones that fit together.

---

Now rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone there? That is part of your spine. Your spine is made of more than thirty small bones stacked on top of each other. Each small bone is called a vertebra. All these bones together protect your spinal cord, which sends messages to your brain.
If you tap on your chest, you can feel your breastbone. The medical name for this bone is the sternum. If you tap to the left or right, you might feel your ribs. Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs. The ribs look like a cage around these organs. Behind your ribs are two bones shaped like a triangle. These are your shoulder blade bones. The medical name for shoulder blade is scapula.

---

The pelvis is the group of bones at your hips. In your lower leg, you have two important bones. The tibia is the bigger bone, and the fibula is the smaller one next to it.
Now let's play Simon Says to practice these bone names! When you take a deep breath, watch how your rib cage can expand to make room for air. Your skeletal system works with your muscular system and nervous system to help you move and stay healthy. Are you ready to play?
Simon says, tap your skull! Simon says, now tap your cranium! Did I trick you? They are the same bone! Simon says, bend over and touch your tibia. Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your ribs expand. Now touch your scapula! Wait - I didn't say Simon says!",,,,,"PART A: Dr. Welbody mentions that she has pictures on her computer to show students. Based on the information in the text, what would be the most important reason for Dr. Welbody to use pictures when teaching about the skeletal system?",MCQ,Pictures would show students that there are more than 200 bones in the human body,Pictures would help Dr. Welbody remember all the bone names she learned in medical school,Pictures would help students see where bones are located and how they protect organs,Pictures would make the lesson more fun and entertaining for third graders,C,"Good try! The story does say there are 200 bones, but the pictures help students see ""where bones are"" and how they protect body parts. The number isn't the main reason for pictures.","Not quite! Dr. Welbody says ""I have pictures to show you,"" so they're for students, not her memory. Pictures help kids see where bones are and how they protect organs.","Great job! You found that pictures help show ""where bones are"" and how they protect organs.

        Last time, we learned the names of some bones in the body. Today, let's learn more about bones! This is a human leg bone called the fibula. The fibula is one of the bones in your leg.

The outside part of a bone is very hard. It is made of the same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. This stuff is called calcium. Do you like milk? Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products. Exercise is also great for your bones.

---

If you could look inside a bone, you would see something called bone marrow. Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture. This picture shows bone marrow cells. You may already know about cells. If you look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that many things are made of tiny cells. Your skin is made of cells. Your bones are made of cells too.

Here you can see some bone marrow cells. There are millions of cells like these inside your bones. The bone marrow cells have a very important job. They work like little factories. They make red blood cells. Then, the red blood cells carry oxygen all around your body.

---

As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong way, bones can break.
This next picture shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture called an x-ray. X-rays help us see inside your body. Your bones are hard, so they show up well in x-ray pictures. The soft tissue around your bones is not as hard. That is why doctors like x-rays. We can take pictures of the inside of your body. We can use x-rays to find out if any bones are broken.

---

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast.
One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed.

The outside part of a bone is very hard. It is made of the same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. This stuff is called calcium. Do you like milk? Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products. Exercise is also great for your bones.

If you could look inside a bone, you would see something called bone marrow. Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture. This picture shows bone marrow cells. You may already know about cells. If you look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that many things are made of tiny cells. Your skin is made of cells. Your bones are made of cells too.

Here you can see some bone marrow cells. There are millions of cells like these inside your bones. The bone marrow cells have a very important job. They work like little factories. They make red blood cells. Then, the red blood cells carry oxygen all around your body.

---

As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong way, bones can break.
This next picture shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture called an x-ray. X-rays help us see inside your body. Your bones are hard, so they show up well in x-ray pictures. The soft tissue around your bones is not as hard. That is why doctors like x-rays. We can take pictures of the inside of your body. We can use x-rays to find out if any bones are broken.

---

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast.
One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed. Then, I cut the cast off for him. He's just fine now.

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone.

One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed.

        Last time, we learned the names of some bones in the body. Today, let's learn more about bones! This is a human leg bone called the fibula. The fibula is one of the bones in your leg.

The outside part of a bone is very hard. It is made of the same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. This stuff is called calcium. Do you like milk? Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products.

        Last time, we learned the names of some bones in the body. Today, let's learn more about bones! This is a human leg bone called the fibula. The fibula is one of the bones in your leg.

The outside part of a bone is very hard. It is made of the same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. This stuff is called calcium. Do you like milk? Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products. Exercise is also great for your bones.

If you could look inside a bone, you would see something called bone marrow. Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture. This picture shows bone marrow cells. You may already know about cells. If you look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that many things are made of tiny cells. Your skin is made of cells. Your bones are made of cells too.

Here you can see some bone marrow cells. There are millions of cells like these inside your bones. The bone marrow cells have a very important job. They work like little factories. They make red blood cells. Then, the red blood cells carry oxygen all around your body.

---

As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong way, bones can break.
This next picture shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture called an x-ray. X-rays help us see inside your body. Your bones are hard, so they show up well in x-ray pictures. The soft tissue around your bones is not as hard. That is why doctors like x-rays. We can take pictures of the inside of your body. We can use x-rays to find out if any bones are broken.

---

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast.
One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed. Then, I cut the cast off for him. He's just fine now.

        Have you ever watched a movie where skeletons chase people around? I saw a funny cartoon like that recently. Some kids were trying to solve a mystery, but they had big problems. Every time they looked for clues, a skeleton would jump out of a grave and run after them!
Well, as a doctor, I need to tell you something important. That's not very realistic at all! Bones cannot move by themselves. In fact, bones don't go anywhere without help from muscles. When I bend my arm, I use my muscle power. I make the muscles in my arm tight, and then the muscles move my bones and the rest of my arm. When you kick a soccer ball, it works the same way. You make the muscles in your legs tight to move your leg bones.

---

Our bodies have many muscles working together. This is called the muscular system. There are about 650 muscles in the human body! That's a lot of muscles. About half of what you weigh comes from your muscles. Pretty amazing, right?
Muscles are very important to us for many reasons. Can you think of some ways we use muscles? Muscles help us run fast and jump high. They let us stand up from a chair and sit back down. We use muscles when we lift heavy things like books or toys. We also use them when we chew our dinner and when we smile at our friends. We even use muscles when we breathe air into our lungs.

---

Doctors put muscles into two main groups. The first group is called voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control and make move when you want them to. The second group is called involuntary muscles. These are muscles that you cannot control at all. Involuntary muscles work automatically without you even thinking about them.
The muscles that help you move your arms and legs are voluntary muscles. When you want to pick up a heavy box, you think about it first. Then you make the muscles in your arms tight so you can lift the box up. You can also control the muscles in your legs when you want to make your body run around the playground or jump over a puddle.

But the muscles in your heart are involuntary muscles. They keep your heart beating all day and all night, whether you are awake or fast asleep.

Well, as a doctor, I need to tell you something important. That's not very realistic at all! Bones cannot move by themselves. In fact, bones don't go anywhere without help from muscles. When I bend my arm, I use my muscle power. I make the muscles in my arm tight, and then the muscles move my bones and the rest of my arm. When you kick a soccer ball, it works the same way. You make the muscles in your legs tight to move your leg bones.

Our bodies have many muscles working together. This is called the muscular system. There are about 650 muscles in the human body! That's a lot of muscles. About half of what you weigh comes from your muscles. Pretty amazing, right?
Muscles are very important to us for many reasons. Can you think of some ways we use muscles? Muscles help us run fast and jump high. They let us stand up from a chair and sit back down. We use muscles when we lift heavy things like books or toys. We also use them when we chew our dinner and when we smile at our friends. We even use muscles when we breathe air into our lungs.

Doctors put muscles into two main groups. The first group is called voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control and make move when you want them to. The second group is called involuntary muscles. These are muscles that you cannot control at all. Involuntary muscles work automatically without you even thinking about them.
The muscles that help you move your arms and legs are voluntary muscles. When you want to pick up a heavy box, you think about it first. Then you make the muscles in your arms tight so you can lift the box up. You can also control the muscles in your legs when you want to make your body run around the playground or jump over a puddle.

We use muscles when we lift heavy things like books or toys. We also use them when we chew our dinner and when we smile at our friends. We even use muscles when we breathe air into our lungs.

Doctors put muscles into two main groups. The first group is called voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control and make move when you want them to. The second group is called involuntary muscles. These are muscles that you cannot control at all. Involuntary muscles work automatically without you even thinking about them.
The muscles that help you move your arms and legs are voluntary muscles. When you want to pick up a heavy box, you think about it first. Then you make the muscles in your arms tight so you can lift the box up. You can also control the muscles in your legs when you want to make your body run around the playground or jump over a puddle.

Well, as a doctor, I need to tell you something important. That's not very realistic at all! Bones cannot move by themselves. In fact, bones don't go anywhere without help from muscles. When I bend my arm, I use my muscle power. I make the muscles in my arm tight, and then the muscles move my bones and the rest of my arm. When you kick a soccer ball, it works the same way. You make the muscles in your legs tight to move your leg bones.

        Have you ever watched a movie where skeletons chase people around? I saw a funny cartoon like that recently. Some kids were trying to solve a mystery, but they had big problems. Every time they looked for clues, a skeleton would jump out of a grave and run after them!
Well, as a doctor, I need to tell you something important. That's not very realistic at all! Bones cannot move by themselves. In fact, bones don't go anywhere without help from muscles. When I bend my arm, I use my muscle power. I make the muscles in my arm tight, and then the muscles move my bones and the rest of my arm. When you kick a soccer ball, it works the same way. You make the muscles in your legs tight to move your leg bones.

---

Our bodies have many muscles working together. This is called the muscular system. There are about 650 muscles in the human body! That's a lot of muscles. About half of what you weigh comes from your muscles. Pretty amazing, right?
Muscles are very important to us for many reasons. Can you think of some ways we use muscles? Muscles help us run fast and jump high. They let us stand up from a chair and sit back down. We use muscles when we lift heavy things like books or toys. We also use them when we chew our dinner and when we smile at our friends. We even use muscles when we breathe air into our lungs.

---

Doctors put muscles into two main groups. The first group is called voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control and make move when you want them to. The second group is called involuntary muscles. These are muscles that you cannot control at all. Involuntary muscles work automatically without you even thinking about them.
The muscles that help you move your arms and legs are voluntary muscles. When you want to pick up a heavy box, you think about it first. Then you make the muscles in your arms tight so you can lift the box up. You can also control the muscles in your legs when you want to make your body run around the playground or jump over a puddle.

Do you know what we call the place where two bones come together? It's called a joint. You have lots of joints in your body. Your elbow is a joint. So is your shoulder and your knee.Many joints are soft because of cartilage. Cartilage is a special kind of connective tissue. It is not as hard as bone, but it is stiffer than muscle. It is also flexible, which means it can bend. Do you remember learning about vertebrae? Those are the bones in your back. Well, we have cartilage between each of the thirty bones in our back. The cartilage works like a soft cushion. It keeps the bones from hitting each other.

When Achilles was a baby, his mother wanted to make sure he would never die. She heard that a person dipped in the River Styx could not be hurt by arrows or spears. She took her son and dipped him in the river. Then she felt better. She believed her son was invulnerable. This means nothing could harm him.
But there was one problem. When she dipped Achilles in the river, she held him by his heel. So his heel never got wet in the special river. Many years later, during the Trojan War, a Trojan warrior shot an arrow at Achilles. The arrow hit right above his heel—the very spot that had not been dipped in the River Styx. Achilles died from his wound. Now you know why the Achilles tendon is named for Achilles.

Do you know what we call the place where two bones come together? It's called a joint. You have lots of joints in your body. Your elbow is a joint. So is your shoulder and your knee.Many joints are soft because of cartilage. Cartilage is a special kind of connective tissue. It is not as hard as bone, but it is stiffer than muscle. It is also flexible, which means it can bend. Do you remember learning about vertebrae? Those are the bones in your back. Well, we have cartilage between each of the thirty bones in our back. The cartilage works like a soft cushion. It keeps the bones from hitting each other.

You also have cartilage in your ears. Try this! Grab the top of your ear and bend it down a little. Now let it go. Do you feel how your ear snaps back? That's the cartilage working!Some very important tissues are found at your joints. A ligament is a kind of tissue that connects one bone to another bone. Most of your joints have ligaments. You have ligaments in your knee, neck, and wrists. For example, ligaments connect your thigh bone to the bones in your lower leg.

Ligaments connect bones to other bones. But tendons connect muscles to bones. Remember how the muscle system and bone system work together? Well, it's the tendons that link these two systems. The tendons connect muscles to bones and help you move. One of the most famous tendons in the body is called the Achilles tendon. Do you know where the Achilles tendon is?
That's right! The Achilles tendon is in the back of your leg, right above your heel. It connects your heel bone to the muscles in your lower leg. This is a very important tendon that you use when you walk or run.

Do you know why this tendon is called the Achilles tendon? Let me tell you the story!
When Achilles was a baby, his mother wanted to make sure he would never die. She heard that a person dipped in the River Styx could not be hurt by arrows or spears. She took her son and dipped him in the river. Then she felt better. She believed her son was invulnerable. This means nothing could harm him.
But there was one problem. When she dipped Achilles in the river, she held him by his heel. So his heel never got wet in the special river. Many years later, during the Trojan War, a Trojan warrior shot an arrow at Achilles. The arrow hit right above his heel—the very spot that had not been dipped in the River Styx. Achilles died from his wound. Now you know why the Achilles tendon is named for Achilles.

Do you know what we call the place where two bones come together? It's called a joint. You have lots of joints in your body. Your elbow is a joint. So is your shoulder and your knee.Many joints are soft because of cartilage. Cartilage is a special kind of connective tissue. It is not as hard as bone, but it is stiffer than muscle. It is also flexible, which means it can bend. Do you remember learning about vertebrae? Those are the bones in your back. Well, we have cartilage between each of the thirty bones in our back. The cartilage works like a soft cushion. It keeps the bones from hitting each other.

        Your body has many different systems that work together. The skeletal system is made up of bones. The muscular system is made up of muscles. The nervous system is made up of nerves! You have about 200 bones in your body. You also have about 650 muscles to help you move those bones around. How many nerves do you think you have? You might guess a thousand or even ten thousand. But you actually have about a billion nerves in your body!
Your nerves are very important. They help you keep track of what's happening around you. The nerves send messages to your brain. Then your brain tells your body what to do. Have you ever walked outside and felt cold? Your body probably told you to go back inside and get a coat. What happened was the nerves in your skin sent a message to your brain. The message was ""It's cold out here!""

Have you ever touched something hot? You probably pulled your hand away very quickly. That happened because your nerves sent a message to your brain right away. Nerves are important for our sense of touch. Without nerves, we couldn't feel if things are hot or cold. We couldn't touch things and know if they are smooth or rough. Nerves are also important for all our other senses. Without nerves, we couldn't see or hear. We couldn't smell or taste our food either.
The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells. A single nerve has many nerve cells inside it. Nerve cells have long stringy parts that go out from the center. The center of the cell is called the cell body. The stringy parts that go away from the cell body are called dendrites. You can think of dendrites like roads. When a nerve wants to send a message to your brain, it sends the message along the dendrites. The message travels along the dendrites just like a car travels on a road.

You will tighten up your muscles just in case someone is trying to hurt you. This is a reflex. When you pull your hand away from a hot stove, that is also a reflex.

        Your body has many different systems that work together. The skeletal system is made up of bones. The muscular system is made up of muscles. The nervous system is made up of nerves! You have about 200 bones in your body. You also have about 650 muscles to help you move those bones around. How many nerves do you think you have? You might guess a thousand or even ten thousand. But you actually have about a billion nerves in your body!
Your nerves are very important. They help you keep track of what's happening around you. The nerves send messages to your brain. Then your brain tells your body what to do. Have you ever walked outside and felt cold? Your body probably told you to go back inside and get a coat. What happened was the nerves in your skin sent a message to your brain. The message was ""It's cold out here!""

Have you ever touched something hot? You probably pulled your hand away very quickly. That happened because your nerves sent a message to your brain right away. Nerves are important for our sense of touch. Without nerves, we couldn't feel if things are hot or cold. We couldn't touch things and know if they are smooth or rough. Nerves are also important for all our other senses. Without nerves, we couldn't see or hear. We couldn't smell or taste our food either.
The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells. A single nerve has many nerve cells inside it. Nerve cells have long stringy parts that go out from the center. The center of the cell is called the cell body. The stringy parts that go away from the cell body are called dendrites. You can think of dendrites like roads. When a nerve wants to send a message to your brain, it sends the message along the dendrites. The message travels along the dendrites just like a car travels on a road.

Has your family doctor ever tapped you on the knee with a little rubber hammer? Did you wonder why the doctor did that? Your doctor was checking your reflexes. This is a way to check if your nerves are working well. A reflex is something your body does without you thinking about it. If someone jumps out and scares you, you might flinch. You will tighten up your muscles just in case someone is trying to hurt you. This is a reflex. When you pull your hand away from a hot stove, that is also a reflex.
When your doctor taps your knee with the hammer, he is looking for a reflex reaction. If your leg moves a little bit, that's a good sign. It means your nervous system is working the way it should.

Have you ever touched something hot? You probably pulled your hand away very quickly. That happened because your nerves sent a message to your brain right away. Nerves are important for our sense of touch. Without nerves, we couldn't feel if things are hot or cold. We couldn't touch things and know if they are smooth or rough. Nerves are also important for all our other senses. Without nerves, we couldn't see or hear. We couldn't smell or taste our food either.
The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells. A single nerve has many nerve cells inside it. Nerve cells have long stringy parts that go out from the center. The center of the cell is called the cell body. The stringy parts that go away from the cell body are called dendrites. You can think of dendrites like roads. When a nerve wants to send a message to your brain, it sends the message along the dendrites. The message travels along the dendrites just like a car travels on a road.

Has your family doctor ever tapped you on the knee with a little rubber hammer? Did you wonder why the doctor did that? Your doctor was checking your reflexes. This is a way to check if your nerves are working well. A reflex is something your body does without you thinking about it. If someone jumps out and scares you, you might flinch. You will tighten up your muscles just in case someone is trying to hurt you. This is a reflex. When you pull your hand away from a hot stove, that is also a reflex.
When your doctor taps your knee with the hammer, he is looking for a reflex reaction. If your leg moves a little bit, that's a good sign. It means your nervous system is working the way it should. This simple test helps doctors make sure your nerves are healthy and doing their job properly.",,,,,How does the author want readers to feel about the number of nerves in the human body?,MCQ,confused about why scientists count nerves,worried that having too many nerves is unhealthy,surprised that the number is much larger than expected,concerned that people do not have enough nerves,C,Good try!

        Your body has many different systems that work together. The skeletal system is made up of bones. The muscular system is made up of muscles. The nervous system is made up of nerves! You have about 200 bones in your body. You also have about 650 muscles to help you move those bones around. How many nerves do you think you have? You might guess a thousand or even ten thousand. But you actually have about a billion nerves in your body!
Your nerves are very important. They help you keep track of what's happening around you. The nerves send messages to your brain. Then your brain tells your body what to do. Have you ever walked outside and felt cold? Your body probably told you to go back inside and get a coat. What happened was the nerves in your skin sent a message to your brain. The message was ""It's cold out here!""

        You have lots of nerves! Really, you do! You have nerves in your fingers and toes. There are nerves all over your body. But two parts of your body are very important for your nervous system. One is the spinal cord. The other is the brain.
Your spinal cord is made up of long strings of nerves. These nerves run through the hollow parts of your spine bones. The spine bones protect your spinal cord. The nerves in your spinal cord go all the way up your back and neck. They connect to your brain.
If someone hurts their spinal cord badly, they might become paralyzed. This means they cannot move their arms or legs. They might need to use a wheelchair to get around. The brain uses the spinal cord like a highway to send messages to the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken, the messages cannot get through.

---

The spinal cord connects to the center of your nervous system - your brain. The brain gets messages from nerves all over your body. It also sends messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain weighs only 2-3 pounds, it is the most important organ for life.
Your skull protects your brain. Inside the skull, there are three layers of fiber and fluid that protect the brain even more. The brain is very well protected, but it can still get hurt. A football player who gets a concussion knows this. A concussion is like bruising the brain. Ouch!

---

The brain has three main parts. Each part has its own special job. The medulla is at the bottom of the brain where it meets the spinal cord. The medulla controls important things your body does without thinking, like breathing and heartbeat.
The cerebellum sits right next to the medulla. It is split into two parts called hemispheres. The cerebellum helps control movements you choose to make, like walking and jumping. The right hemisphere controls the left side of your body. The left hemisphere controls the right side of your body.
The cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It sits on top of the other parts. Different areas of the cerebrum do different jobs. The front part controls feelings. The back part controls sight. The outside layer of the cerebrum is called the cerebral cortex. This wrinkly part is what most people think of when they picture a brain.

For many years, scientists did not know much about what different parts of the brain do. But in the past few decades, they have learned a lot. A decade is ten years. Scientists now have special tools to look at the brain while it works. They use something called a PET scan to see the brain in action.
During a PET scan, a scientist might ask someone to talk or blink. When the person does these things, different parts of the brain light up on a computer screen.

The brain uses the spinal cord like a highway to send messages to the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken, the messages cannot get through.

---

The spinal cord connects to the center of your nervous system - your brain. The brain gets messages from nerves all over your body. It also sends messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain weighs only 2-3 pounds, it is the most important organ for life.
Your skull protects your brain. Inside the skull, there are three layers of fiber and fluid that protect the brain even more. The brain is very well protected, but it can still get hurt. A football player who gets a concussion knows this. A concussion is like bruising the brain. Ouch!

The brain has three main parts. Each part has its own special job. The medulla is at the bottom of the brain where it meets the spinal cord. The medulla controls important things your body does without thinking, like breathing and heartbeat.
The cerebellum sits right next to the medulla. It is split into two parts called hemispheres. The cerebellum helps control movements you choose to make, like walking and jumping. The right hemisphere controls the left side of your body. The left hemisphere controls the right side of your body.
The cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It sits on top of the other parts. Different areas of the cerebrum do different jobs. The front part controls feelings. The back part controls sight. The outside layer of the cerebrum is called the cerebral cortex. This wrinkly part is what most people think of when they picture a brain.

For many years, scientists did not know much about what different parts of the brain do. But in the past few decades, they have learned a lot. A decade is ten years. Scientists now have special tools to look at the brain while it works. They use something called a PET scan to see the brain in action.

        You have lots of nerves! Really, you do! You have nerves in your fingers and toes. There are nerves all over your body. But two parts of your body are very important for your nervous system. One is the spinal cord. The other is the brain.
Your spinal cord is made up of long strings of nerves. These nerves run through the hollow parts of your spine bones. The spine bones protect your spinal cord. The nerves in your spinal cord go all the way up your back and neck. They connect to your brain.
If someone hurts their spinal cord badly, they might become paralyzed. This means they cannot move their arms or legs. They might need to use a wheelchair to get around. The brain uses the spinal cord like a highway to send messages to the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken, the messages cannot get through.

---

The spinal cord connects to the center of your nervous system - your brain. The brain gets messages from nerves all over your body. It also sends messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain weighs only 2-3 pounds, it is the most important organ for life.
Your skull protects your brain. Inside the skull, there are three layers of fiber and fluid that protect the brain even more. The brain is very well protected, but it can still get hurt. A football player who gets a concussion knows this. A concussion is like bruising the brain. Ouch!

---

The brain has three main parts. Each part has its own special job. The medulla is at the bottom of the brain where it meets the spinal cord. The medulla controls important things your body does without thinking, like breathing and heartbeat.
The cerebellum sits right next to the medulla. It is split into two parts called hemispheres. The cerebellum helps control movements you choose to make, like walking and jumping. The right hemisphere controls the left side of your body. The left hemisphere controls the right side of your body.
The cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It sits on top of the other parts. Different areas of the cerebrum do different jobs. The front part controls feelings. The back part controls sight. The outside layer of the cerebrum is called the cerebral cortex. This wrinkly part is what most people think of when they picture a brain.

For many years, scientists did not know much about what different parts of the brain do. But in the past few decades, they have learned a lot. A decade is ten years. Scientists now have special tools to look at the brain while it works. They use something called a PET scan to see the brain in action.
During a PET scan, a scientist might ask someone to talk or blink. When the person does these things, different parts of the brain light up on a computer screen.

        For the past few articles, we have been learning about the body and how it works. Today we will learn about vision, which means how we see things. We have a special guest to help us learn. His name is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. He is an optometrist. An optometrist is a special eye doctor who knows all about eyes and how they work.
Hello! I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn about your amazing eyes? Let's start with the parts you can see when you look at someone's face. The pupil is the black circle in the center of your eye. The iris is the colored part around the pupil. Your iris can be brown, green, blue, or other colors. When people say you have brown eyes, they are talking about your iris.

---

The pupil is always black, but it can change size. When it is dark outside, your pupil gets bigger to let more light into your eye. When it is very bright and sunny, your pupil gets smaller to let less light in. This helps protect your eye from too much light.
Now let's learn about the parts inside your eye that you cannot see. The cornea is like a clear window that covers the front of your eye. It helps keep dirt and germs out of your eye. The lens is inside your eye and helps focus light so you can see clearly. It is curved like the bottom of a spoon.

---

The retina is at the back of your eye. It is made of special tissue that is very sensitive to light. This means it can feel even small amounts of light. The retina has special cells called rods and cones. These rods and cones are like tiny messengers that sense light and send information to your brain.
All the information from your retina travels to your brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is like a highway that carries messages from your eye to your brain very quickly.

---

Here is how you see things. First, light comes into your eye through the cornea. Then it goes through the pupil. If it is dark, your pupil opens wide to let more light in. If it is bright, your pupil gets small to let less light in. Next, the light goes through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina.
The rods and cones in your retina sense the light and send messages through the optic nerve to your brain. Your brain puts together the messages from both eyes to make one clear picture. All of this happens so fast that it seems like you see things right away. But really, your brain needs a tiny moment to understand what you are looking at. That is how vision works!",,,,,Which process happens immediately after light passes through the pupil on its path through the eye?,MCQ,Light is refracted by the lens to focus on the retina,Light first enters the eye through the cornea,Rods and cones convert light into nerve impulses,The optic nerve carries visual signals to the brain,A,"Great job!

        For the past few articles, we have been learning about the body and how it works. Today we will learn about vision, which means how we see things. We have a special guest to help us learn. His name is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. He is an optometrist. An optometrist is a special eye doctor who knows all about eyes and how they work.
Hello! I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn about your amazing eyes? Let's start with the parts you can see when you look at someone's face. The pupil is the black circle in the center of your eye. The iris is the colored part around the pupil. Your iris can be brown, green, blue, or other colors. When people say you have brown eyes, they are talking about your iris.

---

The pupil is always black, but it can change size. When it is dark outside, your pupil gets bigger to let more light into your eye. When it is very bright and sunny, your pupil gets smaller to let less light in. This helps protect your eye from too much light.
Now let's learn about the parts inside your eye that you cannot see. The cornea is like a clear window that covers the front of your eye. It helps keep dirt and germs out of your eye. The lens is inside your eye and helps focus light so you can see clearly. It is curved like the bottom of a spoon.

The retina is at the back of your eye. It is made of special tissue that is very sensitive to light. This means it can feel even small amounts of light. The retina has special cells called rods and cones. These rods and cones are like tiny messengers that sense light and send information to your brain.

If it is bright, your pupil gets small to let less light in. Next, the light goes through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina.
The rods and cones in your retina sense the light and send messages through the optic nerve to your brain. Your brain puts together the messages from both eyes to make one clear picture. All of this happens so fast that it seems like you see things right away. But really, your brain needs a tiny moment to understand what you are looking at. That is how vision works!",,,,,Why does the pupil change size?,MCQ,to change the color or shape of your eyes,to control how much light enters your eye,to help you blink faster,to make your vision sharper and better,B,"Good try!

        For the past few articles, we have been learning about the body and how it works. Today we will learn about vision, which means how we see things. We have a special guest to help us learn. His name is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. He is an optometrist. An optometrist is a special eye doctor who knows all about eyes and how they work.
Hello! I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn about your amazing eyes? Let's start with the parts you can see when you look at someone's face. The pupil is the black circle in the center of your eye. The iris is the colored part around the pupil. Your iris can be brown, green, blue, or other colors. When people say you have brown eyes, they are talking about your iris.

---

The pupil is always black, but it can change size. When it is dark outside, your pupil gets bigger to let more light into your eye. When it is very bright and sunny, your pupil gets smaller to let less light in. This helps protect your eye from too much light.
Now let's learn about the parts inside your eye that you cannot see. The cornea is like a clear window that covers the front of your eye. It helps keep dirt and germs out of your eye. The lens is inside your eye and helps focus light so you can see clearly. It is curved like the bottom of a spoon.

---

The retina is at the back of your eye. It is made of special tissue that is very sensitive to light. This means it can feel even small amounts of light. The retina has special cells called rods and cones. These rods and cones are like tiny messengers that sense light and send information to your brain.
All the information from your retina travels to your brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is like a highway that carries messages from your eye to your brain very quickly.

        For the past few articles, we have been learning about the body and how it works. Today we will learn about vision, which means how we see things. We have a special guest to help us learn. His name is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. He is an optometrist. An optometrist is a special eye doctor who knows all about eyes and how they work.
Hello! I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn about your amazing eyes? Let's start with the parts you can see when you look at someone's face. The pupil is the black circle in the center of your eye. The iris is the colored part around the pupil. Your iris can be brown, green, blue, or other colors. When people say you have brown eyes, they are talking about your iris.

---

The pupil is always black, but it can change size. When it is dark outside, your pupil gets bigger to let more light into your eye. When it is very bright and sunny, your pupil gets smaller to let less light in. This helps protect your eye from too much light.
Now let's learn about the parts inside your eye that you cannot see. The cornea is like a clear window that covers the front of your eye. It helps keep dirt and germs out of your eye. The lens is inside your eye and helps focus light so you can see clearly. It is curved like the bottom of a spoon.

---

The retina is at the back of your eye. It is made of special tissue that is very sensitive to light. This means it can feel even small amounts of light. The retina has special cells called rods and cones. These rods and cones are like tiny messengers that sense light and send information to your brain.
All the information from your retina travels to your brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is like a highway that carries messages from your eye to your brain very quickly.

---

Here is how you see things. First, light comes into your eye through the cornea. Then it goes through the pupil. If it is dark, your pupil opens wide to let more light in. If it is bright, your pupil gets small to let less light in. Next, the light goes through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina.
The rods and cones in your retina sense the light and send messages through the optic nerve to your brain. Your brain puts together the messages from both eyes to make one clear picture. All of this happens so fast that it seems like you see things right away. But really, your brain needs a tiny moment to understand what you are looking at. That is how vision works!",,,,,The author presents information about vision in a way that suggests the author's purpose is to,MCQ,persuade readers to protect their eyes from all bright light,entertain readers with surprising facts about optical illusions,inform readers about the eye's anatomy and function clearly,describe the author's personal experience visiting an optometrist,C,"Good try!

        Last time, we learned about the parts of the eye and how they work together to help us see. Today, we will talk about vision problems and ways to fix them.
Many vision problems happen because of the lens in our eye. The lens is curved and bends light rays so they focus on the retina. When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and lens. These parts bend the light rays so they meet at the same spot on the retina. This gives us perfect vision.

---

Sometimes the cornea is not shaped the right way. When this happens, vision is not perfect. The light rays meet before they touch the retina. Then they hit different places on the retina. This makes a person nearsighted. A nearsighted person can see things that are close, but things far away look blurry.
There is also another vision problem called being farsighted. A farsighted person can see things far away clearly, but things up close look blurry. Both of these problems can be fixed in different ways.

---

Long ago, there was no way to help people with vision problems. Today, we have many ways to help. An optometrist can check and measure the lenses in your eyes. If they are not shaped correctly, the optometrist writes a prescription. This tells an optician what kind of special lenses to make. The optician then makes glasses with these special lenses.
Glasses work by placing a special lens in front of the eye. This lens bends the light in a different way before it enters the eye. When the light rays pass through the eye's cornea and lens, they now meet at the right spot on the retina. This fixes the vision problem.

---

Some people wear a contact lens instead of glasses. Contact lenses work the same way as glasses. The difference is that you insert the lens right into your eye. It sits on top of the cornea and covers the iris and pupil. Contact lenses are almost invisible when you wear them.
There is another way to fix vision problems called LASIK surgery. During this surgery, a doctor uses a laser beam to change the shape of the cornea. The laser beam is a special kind of light that can cut very carefully. Once the cornea is fixed with the laser, a person may not need glasses or contact lenses anymore.",,,,,"In Section 2, what does the word nearsighted mean?",MCQ,can see things far away clearly,cannot see anything at all,can see things that are close clearly,can see everything perfectly,C,"Good try!

Long ago, there was no way to help people with vision problems. Today, we have many ways to help. An optometrist can check and measure the lenses in your eyes. If they are not shaped correctly, the optometrist writes a prescription. This tells an optician what kind of special lenses to make. The optician then makes glasses with these special lenses.
Glasses work by placing a special lens in front of the eye. This lens bends the light in a different way before it enters the eye. When the light rays pass through the eye's cornea and lens, they now meet at the right spot on the retina. This fixes the vision problem.

---

Some people wear a contact lens instead of glasses. Contact lenses work the same way as glasses. The difference is that you insert the lens right into your eye. It sits on top of the cornea and covers the iris and pupil. Contact lenses are almost invisible when you wear them.
There is another way to fix vision problems called LASIK surgery. During this surgery, a doctor uses a laser beam to change the shape of the cornea.

Long ago, there was no way to help people with vision problems. Today, we have many ways to help. An optometrist can check and measure the lenses in your eyes. If they are not shaped correctly, the optometrist writes a prescription. This tells an optician what kind of special lenses to make. The optician then makes glasses with these special lenses.
Glasses work by placing a special lens in front of the eye. This lens bends the light in a different way before it enters the eye. When the light rays pass through the eye's cornea and lens, they now meet at the right spot on the retina. This fixes the vision problem.

Some people wear a contact lens instead of glasses. Contact lenses work the same way as glasses. The difference is that you insert the lens right into your eye. It sits on top of the cornea and covers the iris and pupil. Contact lenses are almost invisible when you wear them.

        Last time, we learned about the parts of the eye and how they work together to help us see. Today, we will talk about vision problems and ways to fix them.
Many vision problems happen because of the lens in our eye. The lens is curved and bends light rays so they focus on the retina. When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and lens. These parts bend the light rays so they meet at the same spot on the retina. This gives us perfect vision.

---

Sometimes the cornea is not shaped the right way. When this happens, vision is not perfect. The light rays meet before they touch the retina. Then they hit different places on the retina. This makes a person nearsighted. A nearsighted person can see things that are close, but things far away look blurry.
There is also another vision problem called being farsighted. A farsighted person can see things far away clearly, but things up close look blurry. Both of these problems can be fixed in different ways.

        Today you will learn about hearing and how your ears work! Dr. Kim Audit is here to teach us. She is a doctor who knows all about ears. She brought a drum to help us understand sound.
""Hello everyone! Can you hear me? Great! Your ears help you every day. They pick up sounds at school and keep you safe on the playground. Let me show you how sound works with this drum,"" says Dr. Audit.
The drum has a thin membrane stretched over a wooden frame. When Dr. Audit hits the drum, the membrane starts to vibrate. This means it moves back and forth very fast. The vibrations make sound waves in the air. These sound waves travel to your ears so you can hear the drum!

---

Your ear has three main parts. The outer ear is the part you can see on the side of your head. It is made of soft tissue and has a special shape. This shape helps catch sounds and guide them inside your ear.
The outer ear has an opening called the ear canal. This is like a tunnel that goes into your head. The ear canal has tiny hairs and special glands that make ear wax. The ear wax helps protect your ear and keeps germs away. At the end of the ear canal is your eardrum. The eardrum is just like Dr. Audit's drum. It has a thin membrane that moves when sound waves hit it.

---

Behind your eardrum is the middle ear. This part has three very small bones with funny names. They are called the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. These bones got their names because of what they look like. The stirrup is the smallest bone in your whole body! It is only as big as a grain of sand.
When your eardrum vibrates, it makes these three tiny bones vibrate too. The bones pass the vibrations to the inner ear. The inner ear has a special part called the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail shell in a spiral coil. It is filled with fluid and lined with tiny hairs.

---

When sound waves reach the cochlea, they make the tiny hairs inside vibrate. These hairs are connected to nerves. The nerves send messages through the auditory nerve straight to your brain. Your brain understands these messages as sounds!
This whole process happens very fast. When Dr. Audit hits her drum, the sound waves travel across the room. They go through your outer ear, down your ear canal, and make your eardrum vibrate. Then the three small bones in your middle ear vibrate. Finally, the hairs in your cochlea vibrate and send messages to your brain. All of this happens faster than you can blink your eyes!",,,,,"Based on Section 4, what happens right before the auditory nerve sends messages to your brain?",MCQ,Sound waves travel across the room.,Your eardrum starts to vibrate.,Three small bones vibrate.,Tiny hairs in the cochlea vibrate.,D,"Good try!

Your ear has three main parts. The outer ear is the part you can see on the side of your head. It is made of soft tissue and has a special shape. This shape helps catch sounds and guide them inside your ear.
The outer ear has an opening called the ear canal. This is like a tunnel that goes into your head. The ear canal has tiny hairs and special glands that make ear wax. The ear wax helps protect your ear and keeps germs away. At the end of the ear canal is your eardrum. The eardrum is just like Dr. Audit's drum. It has a thin membrane that moves when sound waves hit it.

---

Behind your eardrum is the middle ear. This part has three very small bones with funny names. They are called the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. These bones got their names because of what they look like. The stirrup is the smallest bone in your whole body! It is only as big as a grain of sand.
When your eardrum vibrates, it makes these three tiny bones vibrate too. The bones pass the vibrations to the inner ear. The inner ear has a special part called the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail shell in a spiral coil. It is filled with fluid and lined with tiny hairs.

---

When sound waves reach the cochlea, they make the tiny hairs inside vibrate. These hairs are connected to nerves. The nerves send messages through the auditory nerve straight to your brain. Your brain understands these messages as sounds!
This whole process happens very fast. When Dr. Audit hits her drum, the sound waves travel across the room. They go through your outer ear, down your ear canal, and make your eardrum vibrate.

        Today you will learn about hearing and how your ears work! Dr. Kim Audit is here to teach us. She is a doctor who knows all about ears. She brought a drum to help us understand sound.
""Hello everyone! Can you hear me? Great! Your ears help you every day. They pick up sounds at school and keep you safe on the playground. Let me show you how sound works with this drum,"" says Dr. Audit.
The drum has a thin membrane stretched over a wooden frame. When Dr. Audit hits the drum, the membrane starts to vibrate. This means it moves back and forth very fast. The vibrations make sound waves in the air. These sound waves travel to your ears so you can hear the drum!

---

Your ear has three main parts. The outer ear is the part you can see on the side of your head. It is made of soft tissue and has a special shape. This shape helps catch sounds and guide them inside your ear.
The outer ear has an opening called the ear canal. This is like a tunnel that goes into your head. The ear canal has tiny hairs and special glands that make ear wax. The ear wax helps protect your ear and keeps germs away. At the end of the ear canal is your eardrum. The eardrum is just like Dr. Audit's drum. It has a thin membrane that moves when sound waves hit it.

---

Behind your eardrum is the middle ear. This part has three very small bones with funny names. They are called the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. These bones got their names because of what they look like. The stirrup is the smallest bone in your whole body! It is only as big as a grain of sand.
When your eardrum vibrates, it makes these three tiny bones vibrate too. The bones pass the vibrations to the inner ear. The inner ear has a special part called the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail shell in a spiral coil. It is filled with fluid and lined with tiny hairs.

        Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you couldn't hear sounds? Or what if you couldn't see the world around you? Millions of people live with these challenges every day. Some people are deaf, which means they cannot hear well or at all. Other people are blind, which means they cannot see.
People who are deaf have found special ways to talk with others. Many deaf people use American Sign Language. This is a way to communicate using hand movements instead of speaking. Each gesture or hand movement stands for a word or letter. When one person makes these signs, another person can watch and understand the message.
Did you know there is a sign for every letter in the alphabet? You can spell your whole name using these hand signs! Some deaf people also learn to read lips. They watch how a person's mouth moves when they talk. Different sounds make your lips move in different ways. Try talking in a mirror and watch how your lips change shape!

---

Now think about what life would be like if you could not see. How would you walk around your house? How would you know where things are? People who are blind have learned amazing ways to live with their disability. They are overcoming this challenge in many clever ways.
Many blind people use a white cane to help them move around safely. They tap the cane in front of them to feel for walls, steps, and other objects. Some blind people have a special helper called a guide dog. These dogs are trained to help their owners walk safely from place to place. The dogs can stop at curbs and avoid dangerous areas.

---

Blind people also use their other senses more than people who can see. They might recognize you by the sound of your voice or your footsteps. They can tell what food they are eating by how it smells and tastes.
Blind people can also learn to read using a special system called Braille. In Braille, small raised bumps on paper stand for different letters. A blind person runs their fingers over these bumps and feels the patterns. Each pattern of bumps means a different letter. Then they put the letters together to make words, just like you do when you read!

Some people are deaf, which means they cannot hear well or at all. Other people are blind, which means they cannot see.
People who are deaf have found special ways to talk with others. Many deaf people use American Sign Language. This is a way to communicate using hand movements instead of speaking. Each gesture or hand movement stands for a word or letter. When one person makes these signs, another person can watch and understand the message.
Did you know there is a sign for every letter in the alphabet? You can spell your whole name using these hand signs! Some deaf people also learn to read lips. They watch how a person's mouth moves when they talk. Different sounds make your lips move in different ways. Try talking in a mirror and watch how your lips change shape!

Now think about what life would be like if you could not see. How would you walk around your house? How would you know where things are? People who are blind have learned amazing ways to live with their disability. They are overcoming this challenge in many clever ways.
Many blind people use a white cane to help them move around safely. They tap the cane in front of them to feel for walls, steps, and other objects. Some blind people have a special helper called a guide dog. These dogs are trained to help their owners walk safely from place to place. The dogs can stop at curbs and avoid dangerous areas.

---

Blind people also use their other senses more than people who can see. They might recognize you by the sound of your voice or your footsteps. They can tell what food they are eating by how it smells and tastes.
Blind people can also learn to read using a special system called Braille. In Braille, small raised bumps on paper stand for different letters. A blind person runs their fingers over these bumps and feels the patterns. Each pattern of bumps means a different letter. Then they put the letters together to make words, just like you do when you read!
Learning sign language, reading lips, using a guide dog, or reading Braille takes lots of time and practice.

        Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you couldn't hear sounds? Or what if you couldn't see the world around you? Millions of people live with these challenges every day. Some people are deaf, which means they cannot hear well or at all. Other people are blind, which means they cannot see.
People who are deaf have found special ways to talk with others. Many deaf people use American Sign Language. This is a way to communicate using hand movements instead of speaking. Each gesture or hand movement stands for a word or letter. When one person makes these signs, another person can watch and understand the message.
Did you know there is a sign for every letter in the alphabet? You can spell your whole name using these hand signs! Some deaf people also learn to read lips. They watch how a person's mouth moves when they talk. Different sounds make your lips move in different ways. Try talking in a mirror and watch how your lips change shape!

---

Now think about what life would be like if you could not see. How would you walk around your house? How would you know where things are? People who are blind have learned amazing ways to live with their disability. They are overcoming this challenge in many clever ways.
Many blind people use a white cane to help them move around safely. They tap the cane in front of them to feel for walls, steps, and other objects. Some blind people have a special helper called a guide dog. These dogs are trained to help their owners walk safely from place to place. The dogs can stop at curbs and avoid dangerous areas.

---

Blind people also use their other senses more than people who can see. They might recognize you by the sound of your voice or your footsteps. They can tell what food they are eating by how it smells and tastes.
Blind people can also learn to read using a special system called Braille. In Braille, small raised bumps on paper stand for different letters. A blind person runs their fingers over these bumps and feels the patterns. Each pattern of bumps means a different letter. Then they put the letters together to make words, just like you do when you read!
Learning sign language, reading lips, using a guide dog, or reading Braille takes lots of time and practice. But these amazing skills help people live full and happy lives, even when they cannot hear or see like others do.",,,,,Why might blind people tell what food they are eating by smell and taste instead of sight?,MCQ,because their eyes cannot give them information about the food,because smelling and tasting food makes them hungrier,because guide dogs teach them to use these senses,because raised bumps on food containers show ingredients,A,"You got it!

        People with disabilities face extra challenges in life. But these challenges don't stop people who are determined to do great things. Ray Charles was a famous musician who went blind when he was seven years old. He could not see, but his ears worked perfectly. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became one of the most popular musicians of his time.
Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his disability hold him back. His story shows that people can overcome difficulties with hard work and determination.

Helen Keller was another amazing person who overcame disabilities. She lost both her sight and hearing from a serious illness when she was just nineteen months old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life. As a young girl, Helen could not hear or speak. She learned to share a few ideas by making hand movements. When she wanted her mother, she would grab and pull her mother close. When she wanted to be alone, she would push her mom away.
There were only a few ideas she could share this way. There were many things she could not get across with hand movements. As a child, she would often try to talk to people and fail. Then she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted more than anything to talk with people, but she was not able to do so.

Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand words. But how can you understand words if you can't hear them? Sullivan started by giving Helen a doll to hold. Then she took Helen by the hand and traced the letters d-o-l-l on her palm. She did this over and over. After a while, Helen learned to write the letters d-o-l-l on a page. She did not know that she had written a word. She did not even know that words exist. But she felt proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.
Her teacher traced more words on Helen's palm. She learned to spell pin, hat, cup, and other words. The real breakthrough happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word water. Sullivan took Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen's hands under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen's head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful, cool something that was flowing over her hand.

Helen soon learned more words. When she was eight, she went to a special school for the blind. Sullivan went with her. Later, she went to a school for the deaf. But she didn't stop there. She went on to Radcliffe College, where she became the first deaf and blind person to receive a college degree.
Helen learned to speak and read lips with her fingers. She learned to read using Braille. She wrote books, including a story of her own life called The Story of My Life.

        People with disabilities face extra challenges in life. But these challenges don't stop people who are determined to do great things. Ray Charles was a famous musician who went blind when he was seven years old. He could not see, but his ears worked perfectly. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became one of the most popular musicians of his time.
Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his disability hold him back. His story shows that people can overcome difficulties with hard work and determination.

Helen Keller was another amazing person who overcame disabilities. She lost both her sight and hearing from a serious illness when she was just nineteen months old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life. As a young girl, Helen could not hear or speak. She learned to share a few ideas by making hand movements. When she wanted her mother, she would grab and pull her mother close. When she wanted to be alone, she would push her mom away.
There were only a few ideas she could share this way. There were many things she could not get across with hand movements. As a child, she would often try to talk to people and fail. Then she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted more than anything to talk with people, but she was not able to do so.

Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand words. But how can you understand words if you can't hear them? Sullivan started by giving Helen a doll to hold. Then she took Helen by the hand and traced the letters d-o-l-l on her palm. She did this over and over. After a while, Helen learned to write the letters d-o-l-l on a page. She did not know that she had written a word. She did not even know that words exist. But she felt proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.
Her teacher traced more words on Helen's palm. She learned to spell pin, hat, cup, and other words. The real breakthrough happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word water. Sullivan took Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen's hands under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen's head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful, cool something that was flowing over her hand.

Helen soon learned more words. When she was eight, she went to a special school for the blind. Sullivan went with her. Later, she went to a school for the deaf. But she didn't stop there. She went on to Radcliffe College, where she became the first deaf and blind person to receive a college degree.
Helen learned to speak and read lips with her fingers. She learned to read using Braille. She wrote books, including a story of her own life called The Story of My Life. She was active in politics and fought for women to have the right to vote. Helen Keller lived a long and productive life. She died in 1968 at the age of 87.

        People with disabilities face extra challenges in life. But these challenges don't stop people who are determined to do great things. Ray Charles was a famous musician who went blind when he was seven years old. He could not see, but his ears worked perfectly. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became one of the most popular musicians of his time.
Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his disability hold him back. His story shows that people can overcome difficulties with hard work and determination.

---

Helen Keller was another amazing person who overcame disabilities. She lost both her sight and hearing from a serious illness when she was just nineteen months old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life. As a young girl, Helen could not hear or speak. She learned to share a few ideas by making hand movements. When she wanted her mother, she would grab and pull her mother close. When she wanted to be alone, she would push her mom away.
There were only a few ideas she could share this way. There were many things she could not get across with hand movements. As a child, she would often try to talk to people and fail. Then she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted more than anything to talk with people, but she was not able to do so.

Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand words. But how can you understand words if you can't hear them? Sullivan started by giving Helen a doll to hold. Then she took Helen by the hand and traced the letters d-o-l-l on her palm. She did this over and over. After a while, Helen learned to write the letters d-o-l-l on a page. She did not know that she had written a word. She did not even know that words exist. But she felt proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.
Her teacher traced more words on Helen's palm. She learned to spell pin, hat, cup, and other words. The real breakthrough happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word water. Sullivan took Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen's hands under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen's head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful, cool something that was flowing over her hand.

---

Helen soon learned more words. When she was eight, she went to a special school for the blind. Sullivan went with her. Later, she went to a school for the deaf. But she didn't stop there. She went on to Radcliffe College, where she became the first deaf and blind person to receive a college degree.
Helen learned to speak and read lips with her fingers. She learned to read using Braille. She wrote books, including a story of her own life called The Story of My Life. She was active in politics and fought for women to have the right to vote. Helen Keller lived a long and productive life. She died in 1968 at the age of 87.

She did not know that she had written a word. She did not even know that words exist. But she felt proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.
Her teacher traced more words on Helen's palm. She learned to spell pin, hat, cup, and other words. The real breakthrough happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word water. Sullivan took Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen's hands under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen's head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful, cool something that was flowing over her hand.

Helen learned to speak and read lips with her fingers. She learned to read using Braille. She wrote books, including a story of her own life called The Story of My Life.

        People with disabilities face extra challenges in life. But these challenges don't stop people who are determined to do great things. Ray Charles was a famous musician who went blind when he was seven years old. He could not see, but his ears worked perfectly. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became one of the most popular musicians of his time.
Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his disability hold him back. His story shows that people can overcome difficulties with hard work and determination.

---

Helen Keller was another amazing person who overcame disabilities. She lost both her sight and hearing from a serious illness when she was just nineteen months old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life. As a young girl, Helen could not hear or speak. She learned to share a few ideas by making hand movements. When she wanted her mother, she would grab and pull her mother close. When she wanted to be alone, she would push her mom away.
There were only a few ideas she could share this way. There were many things she could not get across with hand movements. As a child, she would often try to talk to people and fail. Then she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted more than anything to talk with people, but she was not able to do so.

""I'll explain,"" Mrs. Teachwell said, ""but please raise your hand if you would like to speak.""
Charlie Chatter nodded. It was not the first time he had heard this. In fact, Mrs. Teachwell had asked him to raise his hand many times. But it was hard for Charlie. His mouth seemed to be faster than his hand.

""Rome started out as a little town along the Tiber River,"" Mrs. Teachwell explained.
""Like Egypt on the Nile?"" Charlie asked.
""Yes,"" said Mrs. Teachwell, ""but let's see that hand!""
The students giggled.
""As Charlie has just reminded us,"" Mrs. Teachwell said, ""many civilizations spring up along the banks of a river. Rome was no different. It sprang up here, on the banks of the Tiber River, among seven hills. At first, Rome was just a few houses on a hill. Then, it grew and grew and grew. After a while, people started building houses on other hills nearby. Then, the little towns on the hills grew together to make a big city. In fact, to this day, Rome is known as the 'City of Seven Hills'.""
""Then, the Romans fought wars with their neighbors. The Romans won most of these wars. They defeated the Etruscans, who lived north of them. They conquered the Greeks, who had settled to the south, as well. It wasn't long before they controlled most of this piece of land that we call Italy.""

Mrs. Teachwell traced the outline of Italy with her finger.
""Check it out!"" Charlie Chatter shouted. ""Italy looks like a boot!""
""Yes,"" said Mrs. Teachwell. ""Italy does look like a boot, but please, Charlie, raise your hand! This is your last warning. Now, does anyone know what this body of water that the boot of Italy sticks out into is called?""
Rachel Readmuch, who always had her nose in a book, raised her hand. Mrs. Teachwell called on her.
""It's called the Mediterranean,"" said Rachel.
""That's right!"" said Mrs. Teachwell. ""This is the Mediterranean Sea. Rome grew so much that, at its peak, the Romans controlled all the land around the Mediterranean Sea. They took over most of Spain and France. They took over this area that we call the Balkans. They took over Greece and much of Turkey. They took over the Middle East, Egypt, and the coast of North Africa.""
Tim Timetable, who loved to learn about when things happened, put up his hand. ""When was all this happening?""
""Rome started growing about two thousand five hundred years ago,"" Mrs. Teachwell explained. ""It started growing about five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, in the years we call BC or BCE. It was still growing when Jesus was born. In fact, Jesus was born here, in a part of the Middle East that was controlled by the Romans.""

article_101039,The Legend of Romulus and Remus,test_quiz,5,quiz_302312,quiz,,"The Legend of Romulus and Remus
    
    
        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

---

The servant found the twins, but he could not bring himself to drown them. Instead, he put the boys in a basket and set it in the river. The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

---

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill. Each knew that it would be important to have a strong wall to protect his city.
After a few days, Remus decided to visit Romulus to see how his city was coming along. He decided to taunt his brother and make fun of his unfinished wall. To taunt means to make fun of someone in a mean way. ""You call that a wall?"" he said. ""That wall would not keep anyone out!"" Then he stepped over the wall to prove his point.

---

That made Romulus very angry. The brothers started to fight with all their might. Suddenly, Remus began to collapse. To collapse means to fall down suddenly. Remus fell to the ground and died. When Romulus saw what he had done, he began to cry. He had not wished to kill his brother.
Romulus went on building his city. He named it Rome after himself. Rome grew and grew until it became a great city at the center of a mighty empire. The government made coins that showed two young boys reaching up to touch a she-wolf. All the people knew who the two boys on the coin were: they were Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. Legendary means famous from old stories that have been told for many years.",,,,,Complete the chronological outline of the founding of Rome by choosing the event that comes next.I. Main CharactersII.

        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

---

The servant found the twins, but he could not bring himself to drown them. Instead, he put the boys in a basket and set it in the river. The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

---

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill. Each knew that it would be important to have a strong wall to protect his city.
After a few days, Remus decided to visit Romulus to see how his city was coming along. He decided to taunt his brother and make fun of his unfinished wall. To taunt means to make fun of someone in a mean way. ""You call that a wall?"" he said. ""That wall would not keep anyone out!"" Then he stepped over the wall to prove his point.

---

That made Romulus very angry. The brothers started to fight with all their might. Suddenly, Remus began to collapse. To collapse means to fall down suddenly. Remus fell to the ground and died. When Romulus saw what he had done, he began to cry. He had not wished to kill his brother.
Romulus went on building his city. He named it Rome after himself. Rome grew and grew until it became a great city at the center of a mighty empire.

        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

---

The servant found the twins, but he could not bring himself to drown them. Instead, he put the boys in a basket and set it in the river. The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

---

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill. Each knew that it would be important to have a strong wall to protect his city.
After a few days, Remus decided to visit Romulus to see how his city was coming along. He decided to taunt his brother and make fun of his unfinished wall. To taunt means to make fun of someone in a mean way. ""You call that a wall?"" he said. ""That wall would not keep anyone out!"" Then he stepped over the wall to prove his point.

---

That made Romulus very angry. The brothers started to fight with all their might. Suddenly, Remus began to collapse. To collapse means to fall down suddenly. Remus fell to the ground and died. When Romulus saw what he had done, he began to cry. He had not wished to kill his brother.
Romulus went on building his city. He named it Rome after himself. Rome grew and grew until it became a great city at the center of a mighty empire.

The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill. Each knew that it would be important to have a strong wall to protect his city.
After a few days, Remus decided to visit Romulus to see how his city was coming along. He decided to taunt his brother and make fun of his unfinished wall. To taunt means to make fun of someone in a mean way. ""You call that a wall?"" he said. ""That wall would not keep anyone out!"" Then he stepped over the wall to prove his point.

That made Romulus very angry. The brothers started to fight with all their might. Suddenly, Remus began to collapse. To collapse means to fall down suddenly. Remus fell to the ground and died. When Romulus saw what he had done, he began to cry. He had not wished to kill his brother.
Romulus went on building his city. He named it Rome after himself. Rome grew and grew until it became a great city at the center of a mighty empire.

        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

        Let's learn about the gods and goddesses of Rome. The ancient Romans did not believe in one God who ruled the entire world. They believed in many gods. In many ways, the Roman gods acted like people. They ate and drank. They played tricks on each other. They fell in love and got into fights. But there was one main way the gods were different from people: the gods were immortal. People might live for many years. Some might even live to be one hundred. But they would die someday. The gods lived forever. They could not die.
The Romans' ideas about their gods were like the ancient Greeks. They worshipped many of the same gods as the Greeks. But they called those gods by different names.

---

The top god was sometimes called the father of the immortal gods. He was a strong, bearded figure. The Greeks called him Zeus. The Romans called him Jupiter. Jupiter was a mighty god. He carried a thunderbolt that he could throw at anyone who made him angry. If Jupiter threw his thunderbolt at you, that was the end of you. Jupiter lived on Mount Olympus with the other gods.
Juno was Jupiter's wife. She was the goddess of marriage and the protector of wives. The Roman gods were all related. They were like a big family. Jupiter's brother Neptune was the god of the seas and oceans.
There are many statues of Neptune. In most of them, he is holding a special three-pointed spear called a trident. Neptune's trident had magical powers. The god could use it to stir up storms and waves. He could also wave it over the stormy seas and make the rough seas smooth.

---

Roman sailors prayed to Neptune. ""Great Neptune!"" they prayed. ""Send us good weather and smooth sailing!"" Mars was the god of war. Soldiers would pray to him before a big battle. The Romans fought many wars, so they spent lots of time praying to Mars.
Mercury was one of Jupiter and Juno's sons. He was the messenger of the gods. He was as fast as lightning. In paintings, he is often shown with wings on his hat and shoes to show how fast he was.
Venus was the goddess of love. She was very beautiful. If Venus wanted someone to fall in love, she could send her son Cupid on a mission. Cupid would shoot the person with one of his magic arrows. The person would then fall in love with the first person they saw. Cupid is still with us today. You will see little Cupids everywhere on Valentine's Day, when we celebrate love.

But there was one main way the gods were different from people: the gods were immortal. People might live for many years. Some might even live to be one hundred. But they would die someday. The gods lived forever. They could not die.
The Romans' ideas about their gods were like the ancient Greeks. They worshipped many of the same gods as the Greeks. But they called those gods by different names.

---

The top god was sometimes called the father of the immortal gods. He was a strong, bearded figure. The Greeks called him Zeus. The Romans called him Jupiter. Jupiter was a mighty god. He carried a thunderbolt that he could throw at anyone who made him angry. If Jupiter threw his thunderbolt at you, that was the end of you. Jupiter lived on Mount Olympus with the other gods.
Juno was Jupiter's wife. She was the goddess of marriage and the protector of wives. The Roman gods were all related. They were like a big family. Jupiter's brother Neptune was the god of the seas and oceans.
There are many statues of Neptune. In most of them, he is holding a special three-pointed spear called a trident. Neptune's trident had magical powers. The god could use it to stir up storms and waves. He could also wave it over the stormy seas and make the rough seas smooth.

---

Roman sailors prayed to Neptune. ""Great Neptune!"" they prayed. ""Send us good weather and smooth sailing!"" Mars was the god of war. Soldiers would pray to him before a big battle. The Romans fought many wars, so they spent lots of time praying to Mars.
Mercury was one of Jupiter and Juno's sons. He was the messenger of the gods. He was as fast as lightning. In paintings, he is often shown with wings on his hat and shoes to show how fast he was.
Venus was the goddess of love. She was very beautiful. If Venus wanted someone to fall in love, she could send her son Cupid on a mission. Cupid would shoot the person with one of his magic arrows. The person would then fall in love with the first person they saw. Cupid is still with us today. You will see little Cupids everywhere on Valentine's Day, when we celebrate love.

        Let's learn about the gods and goddesses of Rome. The ancient Romans did not believe in one God who ruled the entire world. They believed in many gods. In many ways, the Roman gods acted like people. They ate and drank. They played tricks on each other. They fell in love and got into fights. But there was one main way the gods were different from people: the gods were immortal. People might live for many years. Some might even live to be one hundred. But they would die someday. The gods lived forever. They could not die.
The Romans' ideas about their gods were like the ancient Greeks. They worshipped many of the same gods as the Greeks. But they called those gods by different names.

---

The top god was sometimes called the father of the immortal gods. He was a strong, bearded figure. The Greeks called him Zeus. The Romans called him Jupiter. Jupiter was a mighty god. He carried a thunderbolt that he could throw at anyone who made him angry. If Jupiter threw his thunderbolt at you, that was the end of you. Jupiter lived on Mount Olympus with the other gods.
Juno was Jupiter's wife. She was the goddess of marriage and the protector of wives. The Roman gods were all related. They were like a big family. Jupiter's brother Neptune was the god of the seas and oceans.
There are many statues of Neptune. In most of them, he is holding a special three-pointed spear called a trident. Neptune's trident had magical powers. The god could use it to stir up storms and waves. He could also wave it over the stormy seas and make the rough seas smooth.

---

Roman sailors prayed to Neptune. ""Great Neptune!"" they prayed. ""Send us good weather and smooth sailing!"" Mars was the god of war. Soldiers would pray to him before a big battle. The Romans fought many wars, so they spent lots of time praying to Mars.
Mercury was one of Jupiter and Juno's sons. He was the messenger of the gods. He was as fast as lightning. In paintings, he is often shown with wings on his hat and shoes to show how fast he was.
Venus was the goddess of love. She was very beautiful. If Venus wanted someone to fall in love, she could send her son Cupid on a mission. Cupid would shoot the person with one of his magic arrows. The person would then fall in love with the first person they saw. Cupid is still with us today. You will see little Cupids everywhere on Valentine's Day, when we celebrate love.

        Good morning, class! Last time we learned about some of the Roman gods and goddesses. Today, I'd like to tell you about a few more important gods and goddesses that the Romans worshipped.
Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. A blacksmith is someone who works with hot metal to make things. Vulcan would heat up iron and other metals until they were very hot. Then he would hammer and shape the metal to make swords, helmets, and shields for the other gods. Vulcan was also the god of fire and volcanoes. A volcano is a mountain that can shoot out hot melted rock and fire. The Romans believed that when a volcano erupted, it was because Vulcan was working hard in his workshop deep inside the earth.

---

Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and poetry. Both the Greeks and the Romans worshipped Apollo. He had a famous shrine at a place called Delphi in Greece. A shrine is a special holy place where people go to pray and worship their gods. When the Greeks and Romans needed advice about important decisions, they would send messengers to Apollo's shrine at Delphi. There, a priestess would speak for Apollo and give them answers. A priestess is a woman who serves a god or goddess in religious ceremonies. However, the priestess almost never gave clear answers. Instead, she would speak in riddles that people had to figure out for themselves.
Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, crafts, and weaving. According to Roman legend, Minerva was not born like other gods and goddesses. One day, Jupiter had a terrible headache. Suddenly, Minerva sprang out of his head, fully grown and ready for battle! Minerva's special animal was the owl, which Romans thought was very wise. Artists often painted pictures of Minerva with an owl sitting on her shoulder.

---

Diana was the goddess of the moon and hunting. In statues and paintings, artists showed Diana as a young woman carrying a bow and arrows for hunting. Sometimes they would also include her hunting dogs or a deer in the artwork.
Bacchus was the Roman god of grapes and wine. He was always followed by women and creatures called satyrs. A satyr was a magical creature that was half man and half goat. One famous story tells how pirates once tried to kidnap Bacchus. This was a terrible mistake! The angry god used his magic powers to turn himself into a fierce lion. He changed the pirates' boat into a beautiful garden full of plants. As punishment for trying to kidnap him, Bacchus turned all the pirates into dolphins and sent them splashing into the ocean forever.",,,,,The information in this section is best organized as,MCQ,a sequence of events in time order,a comparison of Greek and Roman beliefs,a cause and effect explanation,a description of different gods and goddesses,D,"Good try!

        Good morning, class! Last time we learned about some of the Roman gods and goddesses. Today, I'd like to tell you about a few more important gods and goddesses that the Romans worshipped.
Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. A blacksmith is someone who works with hot metal to make things. Vulcan would heat up iron and other metals until they were very hot. Then he would hammer and shape the metal to make swords, helmets, and shields for the other gods. Vulcan was also the god of fire and volcanoes. A volcano is a mountain that can shoot out hot melted rock and fire. The Romans believed that when a volcano erupted, it was because Vulcan was working hard in his workshop deep inside the earth.

Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and poetry. Both the Greeks and the Romans worshipped Apollo. He had a famous shrine at a place called Delphi in Greece. A shrine is a special holy place where people go to pray and worship their gods. When the Greeks and Romans needed advice about important decisions, they would send messengers to Apollo's shrine at Delphi. There, a priestess would speak for Apollo and give them answers. A priestess is a woman who serves a god or goddess in religious ceremonies. However, the priestess almost never gave clear answers. Instead, she would speak in riddles that people had to figure out for themselves.
Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, crafts, and weaving. According to Roman legend, Minerva was not born like other gods and goddesses. One day, Jupiter had a terrible headache. Suddenly, Minerva sprang out of his head, fully grown and ready for battle! Minerva's special animal was the owl, which Romans thought was very wise. Artists often painted pictures of Minerva with an owl sitting on her shoulder.

Diana was the goddess of the moon and hunting. In statues and paintings, artists showed Diana as a young woman carrying a bow and arrows for hunting. Sometimes they would also include her hunting dogs or a deer in the artwork.

        Good morning, class! Last time we learned about some of the Roman gods and goddesses. Today, I'd like to tell you about a few more important gods and goddesses that the Romans worshipped.
Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. A blacksmith is someone who works with hot metal to make things. Vulcan would heat up iron and other metals until they were very hot. Then he would hammer and shape the metal to make swords, helmets, and shields for the other gods. Vulcan was also the god of fire and volcanoes. A volcano is a mountain that can shoot out hot melted rock and fire. The Romans believed that when a volcano erupted, it was because Vulcan was working hard in his workshop deep inside the earth.

---

Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and poetry. Both the Greeks and the Romans worshipped Apollo. He had a famous shrine at a place called Delphi in Greece. A shrine is a special holy place where people go to pray and worship their gods. When the Greeks and Romans needed advice about important decisions, they would send messengers to Apollo's shrine at Delphi. There, a priestess would speak for Apollo and give them answers. A priestess is a woman who serves a god or goddess in religious ceremonies. However, the priestess almost never gave clear answers. Instead, she would speak in riddles that people had to figure out for themselves.
Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, crafts, and weaving. According to Roman legend, Minerva was not born like other gods and goddesses. One day, Jupiter had a terrible headache. Suddenly, Minerva sprang out of his head, fully grown and ready for battle! Minerva's special animal was the owl, which Romans thought was very wise. Artists often painted pictures of Minerva with an owl sitting on her shoulder.

---

Diana was the goddess of the moon and hunting. In statues and paintings, artists showed Diana as a young woman carrying a bow and arrows for hunting. Sometimes they would also include her hunting dogs or a deer in the artwork.
Bacchus was the Roman god of grapes and wine. He was always followed by women and creatures called satyrs. A satyr was a magical creature that was half man and half goat. One famous story tells how pirates once tried to kidnap Bacchus. This was a terrible mistake! The angry god used his magic powers to turn himself into a fierce lion. He changed the pirates' boat into a beautiful garden full of plants. As punishment for trying to kidnap him, Bacchus turned all the pirates into dolphins and sent them splashing into the ocean forever.",,,,,Who are the creatures that always followed Bacchus?,MCQ,pirates and dolphins,owls and priestesses,women and satyrs,hunting dogs and deer,C,"Good try!

Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and poetry. Both the Greeks and the Romans worshipped Apollo. He had a famous shrine at a place called Delphi in Greece. A shrine is a special holy place where people go to pray and worship their gods. When the Greeks and Romans needed advice about important decisions, they would send messengers to Apollo's shrine at Delphi. There, a priestess would speak for Apollo and give them answers. A priestess is a woman who serves a god or goddess in religious ceremonies. However, the priestess almost never gave clear answers. Instead, she would speak in riddles that people had to figure out for themselves.
Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, crafts, and weaving. According to Roman legend, Minerva was not born like other gods and goddesses. One day, Jupiter had a terrible headache. Suddenly, Minerva sprang out of his head, fully grown and ready for battle! Minerva's special animal was the owl, which Romans thought was very wise. Artists often painted pictures of Minerva with an owl sitting on her shoulder.

Diana was the goddess of the moon and hunting. In statues and paintings, artists showed Diana as a young woman carrying a bow and arrows for hunting. Sometimes they would also include her hunting dogs or a deer in the artwork.
Bacchus was the Roman god of grapes and wine. He was always followed by women and creatures called satyrs. A satyr was a magical creature that was half man and half goat. One famous story tells how pirates once tried to kidnap Bacchus. This was a terrible mistake! The angry god used his magic powers to turn himself into a fierce lion.

        Good morning, class! Last time we learned about some of the Roman gods and goddesses. Today, I'd like to tell you about a few more important gods and goddesses that the Romans worshipped.
Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. A blacksmith is someone who works with hot metal to make things. Vulcan would heat up iron and other metals until they were very hot. Then he would hammer and shape the metal to make swords, helmets, and shields for the other gods. Vulcan was also the god of fire and volcanoes. A volcano is a mountain that can shoot out hot melted rock and fire. The Romans believed that when a volcano erupted, it was because Vulcan was working hard in his workshop deep inside the earth.

        Once there was a king who had three daughters. All three were pretty, but the youngest was named Psyche. She was so beautiful that no words could tell how lovely she was. People started to say she was more beautiful than Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.
Venus heard what people were saying about Psyche. She became very angry and jealous. How could people think a regular girl was prettier than a goddess? Venus decided this had to stop right away!
Venus went to find her son, Cupid. ""My son,"" she said, ""you must punish that girl! Take your bow and arrow and shoot her. Make her fall in love with the ugliest man on Earth."" Cupid always listened to his mother, so he agreed to do his mother's bidding.

---

Cupid took his bow and arrow and flew down to Earth. He found Psyche and took aim at her. But at the last second, his finger slipped on the arrow. Instead of shooting Psyche, he accidentally made the arrow prick his own finger. The magic arrow made Cupid fall in love with Psyche right away!
Now Cupid had a big problem. He loved Psyche, but he could not let his mother know. So he came up with a secret plan. He sent a message to Psyche's family. The message said that the gods had picked a husband for Psyche. She had to climb to the top of a mountain to meet him. The message also said her husband would be a terrible monster, not a man.
Psyche was scared, but she was also brave. She climbed up the mountain as the message told her to do. Halfway up the mountain, a warm wind lifted her up. Suddenly, she found herself in a magnificent palace with beautiful fountains and gardens everywhere.

---

At first, Psyche was all alone in the palace. When night came, she lay down on a soft bed. During the dark night, Cupid came to visit her. He told her he was the husband the gods had chosen for her. Cupid stayed with her all night and was very kind to her. But he always left before the sun came up.
Night after night, Cupid came to see Psyche. He only came when it was dark, and he always left before morning. Psyche only knew him in the darkness, but she accepted him as her husband. One night, Psyche became very curious. She asked her husband why he only came at night when she could not see him.
""Why do you want to see me?"" Cupid asked. ""What does it matter how I look? I love you and treat you well. All I ask is that you love me back.""

---

Psyche understood what her husband said. But she was still curious about what he looked like. Was he really a monster? She felt she had to find out the truth.
One night, Psyche waited until her husband fell asleep. Then she quietly got up and lit a small lamp. She carried the lamp over to the bed and held it up high. What she saw was not a monster at all! Instead, she saw the lovely face of Cupid himself. Her hand shook with surprise and joy. A drop of hot oil fell from the lamp onto Cupid's shoulder and woke him up.
Cupid looked up at Psyche with sad eyes. ""I only asked you to trust me,"" he said. ""But now I see that you do not trust me. When trust is gone, love must depart.""

""Why do you want to see me?"" Cupid asked. ""What does it matter how I look? I love you and treat you well. All I ask is that you love me back.""

Psyche understood what her husband said. But she was still curious about what he looked like. Was he really a monster? She felt she had to find out the truth.
One night, Psyche waited until her husband fell asleep. Then she quietly got up and lit a small lamp. She carried the lamp over to the bed and held it up high. What she saw was not a monster at all! Instead, she saw the lovely face of Cupid himself. Her hand shook with surprise and joy. A drop of hot oil fell from the lamp onto Cupid's shoulder and woke him up.
Cupid looked up at Psyche with sad eyes. ""I only asked you to trust me,"" he said. ""But now I see that you do not trust me. When trust is gone, love must depart.""

        Once there was a king who had three daughters. All three were pretty, but the youngest was named Psyche. She was so beautiful that no words could tell how lovely she was. People started to say she was more beautiful than Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.
Venus heard what people were saying about Psyche. She became very angry and jealous. How could people think a regular girl was prettier than a goddess? Venus decided this had to stop right away!
Venus went to find her son, Cupid. ""My son,"" she said, ""you must punish that girl! Take your bow and arrow and shoot her. Make her fall in love with the ugliest man on Earth."" Cupid always listened to his mother, so he agreed to do his mother's bidding.

---

Cupid took his bow and arrow and flew down to Earth. He found Psyche and took aim at her. But at the last second, his finger slipped on the arrow. Instead of shooting Psyche, he accidentally made the arrow prick his own finger. The magic arrow made Cupid fall in love with Psyche right away!
Now Cupid had a big problem. He loved Psyche, but he could not let his mother know. So he came up with a secret plan. He sent a message to Psyche's family. The message said that the gods had picked a husband for Psyche. She had to climb to the top of a mountain to meet him. The message also said her husband would be a terrible monster, not a man.
Psyche was scared, but she was also brave. She climbed up the mountain as the message told her to do. Halfway up the mountain, a warm wind lifted her up. Suddenly, she found herself in a magnificent palace with beautiful fountains and gardens everywhere.

At first, Psyche was all alone in the palace. When night came, she lay down on a soft bed. During the dark night, Cupid came to visit her. He told her he was the husband the gods had chosen for her. Cupid stayed with her all night and was very kind to her. But he always left before the sun came up.

        Once there was a king who had three daughters. All three were pretty, but the youngest was named Psyche. She was so beautiful that no words could tell how lovely she was. People started to say she was more beautiful than Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.
Venus heard what people were saying about Psyche. She became very angry and jealous. How could people think a regular girl was prettier than a goddess? Venus decided this had to stop right away!
Venus went to find her son, Cupid. ""My son,"" she said, ""you must punish that girl! Take your bow and arrow and shoot her. Make her fall in love with the ugliest man on Earth."" Cupid always listened to his mother, so he agreed to do his mother's bidding.

---

Cupid took his bow and arrow and flew down to Earth. He found Psyche and took aim at her. But at the last second, his finger slipped on the arrow. Instead of shooting Psyche, he accidentally made the arrow prick his own finger. The magic arrow made Cupid fall in love with Psyche right away!
Now Cupid had a big problem. He loved Psyche, but he could not let his mother know. So he came up with a secret plan. He sent a message to Psyche's family. The message said that the gods had picked a husband for Psyche. She had to climb to the top of a mountain to meet him. The message also said her husband would be a terrible monster, not a man.
Psyche was scared, but she was also brave. She climbed up the mountain as the message told her to do. Halfway up the mountain, a warm wind lifted her up. Suddenly, she found herself in a magnificent palace with beautiful fountains and gardens everywhere.

---

At first, Psyche was all alone in the palace. When night came, she lay down on a soft bed. During the dark night, Cupid came to visit her. He told her he was the husband the gods had chosen for her. Cupid stayed with her all night and was very kind to her. But he always left before the sun came up.
Night after night, Cupid came to see Psyche. He only came when it was dark, and he always left before morning. Psyche only knew him in the darkness, but she accepted him as her husband. One night, Psyche became very curious. She asked her husband why he only came at night when she could not see him.
""Why do you want to see me?"" Cupid asked. ""What does it matter how I look? I love you and treat you well. All I ask is that you love me back.""

---

Psyche understood what her husband said. But she was still curious about what he looked like. Was he really a monster? She felt she had to find out the truth.
One night, Psyche waited until her husband fell asleep. Then she quietly got up and lit a small lamp. She carried the lamp over to the bed and held it up high. What she saw was not a monster at all!

Cupid looked up at Psyche with sad eyes. ""I only asked you to trust me,"" he said. ""But now I see that you do not trust me. When trust is gone, love must depart.""

        When Cupid left Psyche, she felt very sad. She looked for Cupid everywhere. She walked during the day and night. But she could not find her lost love anywhere. Finally, Psyche went to Venus's temple. She asked the goddess to help her find Cupid. Venus did not want to help. She was still jealous of Psyche's beauty. Venus was confident that she could give Psyche a task that was too hard to finish.
Venus led Psyche to a huge pile of grain. The pile had wheat, millet, barley, and lentils all mixed together. ""Sort all the grains into separate stacks by morning,"" Venus ordered. Then she gave a mean laugh and disappeared. Psyche saw millions of seeds in the pile. She knew she could never finish this job. She sat down and began to cry.

Then something amazing happened. Through her tears, Psyche saw one seed moving, then another, and then many more. An army of ants had come to aid her! Each ant carried a seed. Working together, they sorted all the seeds into separate piles. In the morning, Venus was shocked to find the work was done.
""Your next task will be much harder!"" Venus said. ""Take this box to the underworld and ask Queen Proserpina to send me some of her beauty."" Psyche's heart sank. No human had ever gone to the underworld and come back alive. Just then, a mysterious voice spoke to her.

""Take a coin for the boatman,"" the voice said. ""If you pay him, he will carry you across the river to the underworld. Take a cake too.

        When Cupid left Psyche, she felt very sad. She looked for Cupid everywhere. She walked during the day and night. But she could not find her lost love anywhere. Finally, Psyche went to Venus's temple. She asked the goddess to help her find Cupid. Venus did not want to help. She was still jealous of Psyche's beauty. Venus was confident that she could give Psyche a task that was too hard to finish.
Venus led Psyche to a huge pile of grain. The pile had wheat, millet, barley, and lentils all mixed together. ""Sort all the grains into separate stacks by morning,"" Venus ordered. Then she gave a mean laugh and disappeared. Psyche saw millions of seeds in the pile. She knew she could never finish this job. She sat down and began to cry.

""Your next task will be much harder!"" Venus said. ""Take this box to the underworld and ask Queen Proserpina to send me some of her beauty."" Psyche's heart sank. No human had ever gone to the underworld and come back alive. Just then, a mysterious voice spoke to her.

""Your next task will be much harder!"" Venus said. ""Take this box to the underworld and ask Queen Proserpina to send me some of her beauty."" Psyche's heart sank. No human had ever gone to the underworld and come back alive. Just then, a mysterious voice spoke to her.

---

""Take a coin for the boatman,"" the voice said. ""If you pay him, he will carry you across the river to the underworld. Take a cake too. Give the cake to the three-headed dog who guards the entrance, and he will let you pass. Most important of all, once Proserpina puts beauty in the box, do not open it!""
Psyche followed the voice's advice. She traveled safely to the underworld. Queen Proserpina gave her the box of beauty for Venus. But Psyche wondered what was inside the box. She lifted the lid and looked inside. A deep sleep came over her right away. She fell to the ground.

---

Luckily, Cupid was watching over her. Even though he was upset with Psyche, he still loved her very much. When he saw her lying on the ground, he felt pity for her. He lifted the sleeping spell and Psyche woke up. ""See what happens when you are too curious?"" Cupid said with a smile. Psyche smiled back at him.
Psyche brought the box to Venus. Then Cupid went to Jupiter and asked to marry Psyche with the king of the gods' blessing. Jupiter agreed. He let Psyche drink ambrosia, the special drink of the gods.

        Have you ever wished you could be a king? Does that seem like the best job in the world? Well, before you decide, listen to this old story. A Roman writer named Cicero told this story more than two thousand years ago.
Damocles was a friend of Dionysius, who was the king of Syracuse. This was a big city in southern Italy. Damocles looked at his friend's life and felt jealous. He would envy the king because he thought the king had everything good in life. The king had lots of money, a big palace, and all the power he wanted. What could be better than that?

---

""You think I'm lucky?"" Dionysius said to his friend one day. ""If you really think so, let's switch places. You can sit on my throne. Try being king for just one day. Then tell me if you still think I'm the lucky one.""
Damocles said yes right away. He was very excited to live like a king, even if it was just for one day. He thought it would be the best day of his life.

---

When the special day came, Damocles told servants to bring him the finest clothes. He ordered them to make a great banquet with lots of delicious food. He wanted expensive wine and beautiful music too. He sat back in the king's chair, sure that he was the happiest person in the whole world.
Then he looked up at the ceiling. He gasped in fear! Above his head was a sharp sword. It was hanging from the ceiling, held up by just one thin piece of horse hair. The sword would dangle right over his head. Damocles could not speak. He could not eat any of the good food. He could not enjoy the music. He was too scared to even move.

---

""What is wrong, my friend?"" asked Dionysius.
""How can I conduct my life with that sword hanging above me?"" Damocles asked. ""It might fall at any time!""
""How indeed?"" answered Dionysius. ""Now you know what it feels like to be king. That sword hangs over my head every minute of every day. There is always a chance the thin hair will break. An advisor who helps me might turn against me. An enemy might try to hurt me. I might make a bad choice that causes my downfall.

        Have you ever wished you could be a king? Does that seem like the best job in the world? Well, before you decide, listen to this old story. A Roman writer named Cicero told this story more than two thousand years ago.
Damocles was a friend of Dionysius, who was the king of Syracuse. This was a big city in southern Italy. Damocles looked at his friend's life and felt jealous. He would envy the king because he thought the king had everything good in life. The king had lots of money, a big palace, and all the power he wanted. What could be better than that?

""You think I'm lucky?"" Dionysius said to his friend one day. ""If you really think so, let's switch places. You can sit on my throne. Try being king for just one day. Then tell me if you still think I'm the lucky one.""
Damocles said yes right away. He was very excited to live like a king, even if it was just for one day. He thought it would be the best day of his life.

When the special day came, Damocles told servants to bring him the finest clothes. He ordered them to make a great banquet with lots of delicious food. He wanted expensive wine and beautiful music too. He sat back in the king's chair, sure that he was the happiest person in the whole world.
Then he looked up at the ceiling. He gasped in fear! Above his head was a sharp sword. It was hanging from the ceiling, held up by just one thin piece of horse hair. The sword would dangle right over his head. Damocles could not speak. He could not eat any of the good food. He could not enjoy the music. He was too scared to even move.

        Have you ever wished you could be a king? Does that seem like the best job in the world? Well, before you decide, listen to this old story. A Roman writer named Cicero told this story more than two thousand years ago.
Damocles was a friend of Dionysius, who was the king of Syracuse. This was a big city in southern Italy. Damocles looked at his friend's life and felt jealous. He would envy the king because he thought the king had everything good in life. The king had lots of money, a big palace, and all the power he wanted. What could be better than that?

---

""You think I'm lucky?"" Dionysius said to his friend one day. ""If you really think so, let's switch places. You can sit on my throne. Try being king for just one day. Then tell me if you still think I'm the lucky one.""
Damocles said yes right away. He was very excited to live like a king, even if it was just for one day. He thought it would be the best day of his life.

---

When the special day came, Damocles told servants to bring him the finest clothes. He ordered them to make a great banquet with lots of delicious food. He wanted expensive wine and beautiful music too. He sat back in the king's chair, sure that he was the happiest person in the whole world.
Then he looked up at the ceiling. He gasped in fear! Above his head was a sharp sword. It was hanging from the ceiling, held up by just one thin piece of horse hair. The sword would dangle right over his head. Damocles could not speak. He could not eat any of the good food. He could not enjoy the music. He was too scared to even move.

---

""What is wrong, my friend?"" asked Dionysius.
""How can I conduct my life with that sword hanging above me?"" Damocles asked. ""It might fall at any time!""
""How indeed?"" answered Dionysius. ""Now you know what it feels like to be king. That sword hangs over my head every minute of every day. There is always a chance the thin hair will break.

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well. Some were bad men who treated the Romans poorly. One king was so terrible that he made the Romans decide they should get rid of kings forever. His name was Tarquin. The Romans called him Tarquin the Proud.
Tarquin was a tyrant. He was a cruel ruler who treated the people badly. He made unfair laws and hurt anyone who spoke against him. In the end, the people got so angry at Tarquin that they joined together and drove him out of Rome. Once King Tarquin had been kicked out, the Romans set up a completely different kind of government. They created a republic—a type of government with no kings at all.

---

One of the most important parts of the Roman republic was the Senate. The Senate was a group of older men who met together to make decisions and pass laws for Rome. Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.
The patricians came from wealthy, old families that had lived in Rome for many years. All of the men in the Senate were patricians. In the early days of the republic, the men chosen to be consuls were also patricians. The rest of the people—the ones who were not patricians—were called plebeians. The plebeians were the poorer people who had very little power in the government.

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well. Some were bad men who treated the Romans poorly. One king was so terrible that he made the Romans decide they should get rid of kings forever. His name was Tarquin. The Romans called him Tarquin the Proud.
Tarquin was a tyrant. He was a cruel ruler who treated the people badly. He made unfair laws and hurt anyone who spoke against him. In the end, the people got so angry at Tarquin that they joined together and drove him out of Rome. Once King Tarquin had been kicked out, the Romans set up a completely different kind of government. They created a republic—a type of government with no kings at all.

One of the most important parts of the Roman republic was the Senate. The Senate was a group of older men who met together to make decisions and pass laws for Rome. Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.
The patricians came from wealthy, old families that had lived in Rome for many years. All of the men in the Senate were patricians. In the early days of the republic, the men chosen to be consuls were also patricians. The rest of the people—the ones who were not patricians—were called plebeians. The plebeians were the poorer people who had very little power in the government.

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well. Some were bad men who treated the Romans poorly. One king was so terrible that he made the Romans decide they should get rid of kings forever. His name was Tarquin. The Romans called him Tarquin the Proud.
Tarquin was a tyrant. He was a cruel ruler who treated the people badly. He made unfair laws and hurt anyone who spoke against him. In the end, the people got so angry at Tarquin that they joined together and drove him out of Rome. Once King Tarquin had been kicked out, the Romans set up a completely different kind of government. They created a republic—a type of government with no kings at all.

---

One of the most important parts of the Roman republic was the Senate. The Senate was a group of older men who met together to make decisions and pass laws for Rome. Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

---

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.
The patricians came from wealthy, old families that had lived in Rome for many years. All of the men in the Senate were patricians. In the early days of the republic, the men chosen to be consuls were also patricians. The rest of the people—the ones who were not patricians—were called plebeians. The plebeians were the poorer people who had very little power in the government.

---

The Roman republic lasted for more than five hundred years. Many Romans loved their republic and thought it was the best kind of government a country could have. However, they were not the only ones who felt this way about republics.
The Founding Fathers of the United States also believed a republic was the best form of government. When the American colonies broke away from Great Britain in 1776, they left behind a king and set up their own republic. They created a Senate that was based on the Roman Senate. They created a president who had powers similar to the Roman consuls. They even built government buildings that looked like ancient Roman structures.

Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.
The patricians came from wealthy, old families that had lived in Rome for many years. All of the men in the Senate were patricians. In the early days of the republic, the men chosen to be consuls were also patricians. The rest of the people—the ones who were not patricians—were called plebeians. The plebeians were the poorer people who had very little power in the government.

The Roman republic lasted for more than five hundred years. Many Romans loved their republic and thought it was the best kind of government a country could have. However, they were not the only ones who felt this way about republics.
The Founding Fathers of the United States also believed a republic was the best form of government. When the American colonies broke away from Great Britain in 1776, they left behind a king and set up their own republic. They created a Senate that was based on the Roman Senate.

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well.

        The Romans fought many enemies, but their strongest enemy was an African general named Hannibal. Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast of Africa. Carthage was home to many merchants and traders. The people of Carthage also had a strong army and navy. They took over much of North Africa and Spain. They even took over islands near Italy. The Romans saw Carthage as a rival. A rival is someone who competes against you. The Romans fought three wars against Carthage. These wars are called the Punic Wars. They were fought from 264 to 146 BC.
Hannibal's father fought against Rome in the First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC. He made his son promise to keep fighting Rome. Hannibal promised he would and kept his word. Hannibal led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

---

Hannibal gathered a huge army in Spain. He had tens of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special forces: a group of elephants. Hannibal knew that few men were brave enough to fight when they saw a thundering group of elephants coming their way.
Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. But to get to Italy, he had to march his army over tall mountains called the Alps. The Alps were very high. The mountain tops were covered with snow and ice. There were no big roads across them. There were only a few slippery paths.
Most men would not have tried to cross the mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered terribly. Some died from rockslides or from an avalanche. An avalanche is when snow and ice come crashing down a mountain. Others froze to death. Many of the elephants did not make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army across the mountains and into Italy.

In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack. He beat the Romans at Trebbia in 218 BC. Then he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of Trasimene in 217 BC. The Romans lost 15,000 men. The Battle of Cannae was even worse. The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including 80 of their 300 senators.
People thought this might be the end for Rome. They did not see how the Romans could keep going. But the Romans did keep going. They raised another army to stop Hannibal. This time, the Romans avoided big battles. Instead, they fought many small battles. They attacked Hannibal's army here and there. They blocked his troops and slowed down his marches. They also launched a counter-attack. A counter-attack is when you fight back against your enemy. A Roman general named Scipio took Roman troops to Africa. The leaders of Carthage wrote to Hannibal. They told him to come home and protect Carthage.

        The Romans fought many enemies, but their strongest enemy was an African general named Hannibal. Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast of Africa. Carthage was home to many merchants and traders. The people of Carthage also had a strong army and navy. They took over much of North Africa and Spain. They even took over islands near Italy. The Romans saw Carthage as a rival. A rival is someone who competes against you. The Romans fought three wars against Carthage. These wars are called the Punic Wars. They were fought from 264 to 146 BC.
Hannibal's father fought against Rome in the First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC. He made his son promise to keep fighting Rome. Hannibal promised he would and kept his word. Hannibal led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

---

Hannibal gathered a huge army in Spain. He had tens of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special forces: a group of elephants. Hannibal knew that few men were brave enough to fight when they saw a thundering group of elephants coming their way.
Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. But to get to Italy, he had to march his army over tall mountains called the Alps. The Alps were very high. The mountain tops were covered with snow and ice. There were no big roads across them. There were only a few slippery paths.
Most men would not have tried to cross the mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered terribly. Some died from rockslides or from an avalanche. An avalanche is when snow and ice come crashing down a mountain. Others froze to death. Many of the elephants did not make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army across the mountains and into Italy.

---

In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack. He beat the Romans at Trebbia in 218 BC. Then he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of Trasimene in 217 BC. The Romans lost 15,000 men. The Battle of Cannae was even worse. The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including 80 of their 300 senators.
People thought this might be the end for Rome. They did not see how the Romans could keep going. But the Romans did keep going. They raised another army to stop Hannibal. This time, the Romans avoided big battles. Instead, they fought many small battles. They attacked Hannibal's army here and there. They blocked his troops and slowed down his marches. They also launched a counter-attack. A counter-attack is when you fight back against your enemy. A Roman general named Scipio took Roman troops to Africa. The leaders of Carthage wrote to Hannibal. They told him to come home and protect Carthage.

Hannibal did as he was told. He left Italy and returned to Carthage. At the Battle of Zama, he had to confront Scipio. To confront means to face someone in battle. This time, the Romans were victorious. Being victorious means winning the battle. Hannibal won most of the battles in the Second Punic War, but he lost the war.

People thought this might be the end for Rome. They did not see how the Romans could keep going. But the Romans did keep going. They raised another army to stop Hannibal.

        The Romans fought many enemies, but their strongest enemy was an African general named Hannibal. Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast of Africa. Carthage was home to many merchants and traders. The people of Carthage also had a strong army and navy. They took over much of North Africa and Spain. They even took over islands near Italy. The Romans saw Carthage as a rival. A rival is someone who competes against you. The Romans fought three wars against Carthage. These wars are called the Punic Wars. They were fought from 264 to 146 BC.
Hannibal's father fought against Rome in the First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC. He made his son promise to keep fighting Rome. Hannibal promised he would and kept his word. Hannibal led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

---

Hannibal gathered a huge army in Spain. He had tens of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special forces: a group of elephants. Hannibal knew that few men were brave enough to fight when they saw a thundering group of elephants coming their way.
Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. But to get to Italy, he had to march his army over tall mountains called the Alps. The Alps were very high. The mountain tops were covered with snow and ice. There were no big roads across them. There were only a few slippery paths.
Most men would not have tried to cross the mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered terribly. Some died from rockslides or from an avalanche. An avalanche is when snow and ice come crashing down a mountain. Others froze to death. Many of the elephants did not make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army across the mountains and into Italy.

        After the Punic Wars, Roman generals became very important people. These generals traveled all around the Mediterranean Sea. They fought battles and took over new lands for Rome. Some generals became famous heroes. They were so popular that people worried they might try to take control of the whole republic. This is exactly what happened with a man named Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family that had been important for many years. He was very proud and wanted to become powerful. Caesar had a very high opinion of himself. When Caesar was still a young man, something exciting happened to him. Pirates captured him while he was traveling by ship!

---

The pirates told Caesar they would kill him unless someone paid them money. This payment to free a prisoner is called a ransom. They wanted twenty talents of gold. A talent was a lot of money in those days. But Caesar just laughed at the pirates! He told them they clearly did not know what kind of important man they had captured. Caesar said he would not allow himself to be ransomed for such a small amount. He demanded they ask for fifty talents instead!
Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

---

The pirates thought Caesar was just joking or maybe even crazy. As soon as they got their ransom money, they let him go and forgot all about him. But Caesar never forgot about them. He went back to Rome and got some ships. He hired good fighters and tracked down those pirates. Then he killed them, just like he had promised!
Caesar quickly learned to establish himself as a great leader. To establish means to set up or create something strong. He was good with both his sword for fighting and his pen for writing. Once, Caesar was sent to Asia because the people there were in revolt. A revolt is when people fight against their rulers. Caesar led a Roman army and stopped the revolt. Then he wrote his report to Rome.

---

Most generals wrote long reports that filled many pages. But that was not Caesar's style. His whole report was just three Latin words: ""Veni, vidi, vici."" In English, this means ""I came, I saw, I conquered."" What else needed to be said? Mission accomplished!
Later, Caesar led an army into a land called Gaul. Today we call this place France. When Caesar marched in, Gaul was not part of Roman civilization. But when he marched out years later, it belonged to Rome. Caesar had conquered the whole land. Then he wrote a famous book about how he did it.

        After the Punic Wars, Roman generals became very important people. These generals traveled all around the Mediterranean Sea. They fought battles and took over new lands for Rome. Some generals became famous heroes. They were so popular that people worried they might try to take control of the whole republic. This is exactly what happened with a man named Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family that had been important for many years. He was very proud and wanted to become powerful. Caesar had a very high opinion of himself. When Caesar was still a young man, something exciting happened to him. Pirates captured him while he was traveling by ship!

---

The pirates told Caesar they would kill him unless someone paid them money. This payment to free a prisoner is called a ransom. They wanted twenty talents of gold. A talent was a lot of money in those days. But Caesar just laughed at the pirates! He told them they clearly did not know what kind of important man they had captured. Caesar said he would not allow himself to be ransomed for such a small amount. He demanded they ask for fifty talents instead!
Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

        After the Punic Wars, Roman generals became very important people. These generals traveled all around the Mediterranean Sea. They fought battles and took over new lands for Rome. Some generals became famous heroes. They were so popular that people worried they might try to take control of the whole republic. This is exactly what happened with a man named Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family that had been important for many years. He was very proud and wanted to become powerful. Caesar had a very high opinion of himself. When Caesar was still a young man, something exciting happened to him. Pirates captured him while he was traveling by ship!

---

The pirates told Caesar they would kill him unless someone paid them money. This payment to free a prisoner is called a ransom. They wanted twenty talents of gold. A talent was a lot of money in those days. But Caesar just laughed at the pirates! He told them they clearly did not know what kind of important man they had captured. Caesar said he would not allow himself to be ransomed for such a small amount. He demanded they ask for fifty talents instead!
Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

The pirates thought Caesar was just joking or maybe even crazy. As soon as they got their ransom money, they let him go and forgot all about him. But Caesar never forgot about them. He went back to Rome and got some ships. He hired good fighters and tracked down those pirates. Then he killed them, just like he had promised!
Caesar quickly learned to establish himself as a great leader. To establish means to set up or create something strong. He was good with both his sword for fighting and his pen for writing.

        After the Punic Wars, Roman generals became very important people. These generals traveled all around the Mediterranean Sea. They fought battles and took over new lands for Rome. Some generals became famous heroes. They were so popular that people worried they might try to take control of the whole republic. This is exactly what happened with a man named Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family that had been important for many years. He was very proud and wanted to become powerful. Caesar had a very high opinion of himself. When Caesar was still a young man, something exciting happened to him. Pirates captured him while he was traveling by ship!

---

The pirates told Caesar they would kill him unless someone paid them money. This payment to free a prisoner is called a ransom. They wanted twenty talents of gold. A talent was a lot of money in those days. But Caesar just laughed at the pirates! He told them they clearly did not know what kind of important man they had captured. Caesar said he would not allow himself to be ransomed for such a small amount. He demanded they ask for fifty talents instead!
Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

---

The pirates thought Caesar was just joking or maybe even crazy. As soon as they got their ransom money, they let him go and forgot all about him. But Caesar never forgot about them. He went back to Rome and got some ships. He hired good fighters and tracked down those pirates. Then he killed them, just like he had promised!
Caesar quickly learned to establish himself as a great leader. To establish means to set up or create something strong. He was good with both his sword for fighting and his pen for writing. Once, Caesar was sent to Asia because the people there were in revolt. A revolt is when people fight against their rulers. Caesar led a Roman army and stopped the revolt. Then he wrote his report to Rome.

---

Most generals wrote long reports that filled many pages. But that was not Caesar's style. His whole report was just three Latin words: ""Veni, vidi, vici."" In English, this means ""I came, I saw, I conquered."" What else needed to be said? Mission accomplished!
Later, Caesar led an army into a land called Gaul. Today we call this place France. When Caesar marched in, Gaul was not part of Roman civilization. But when he marched out years later, it belonged to Rome. Caesar had conquered the whole land. Then he wrote a famous book about how he did it.

        After Caesar won his battles in Gaul, he started marching back to Rome. The Roman senators were very worried about Caesar. They thought he might march into Rome and take over their government. The senators sent Caesar a message. They told him to stop and send his soldiers home. They ordered him not to cross the Rubicon River. If he crossed it, they said he would not be treated as a hero. Instead, he would be treated as a traitor and an enemy of Rome.
In the year 49 BC, Caesar made his choice. He crossed the Rubicon River with his army. He said in Latin, ""The die is cast."" That was his way of saying he knew he was taking a big risk. Crossing the Rubicon meant there was no turning back. He had to fight or lose everything.

Caesar's actions started a civil war. A civil war is when people from the same country fight against each other. Caesar was the leader on one side. Pompey, another famous Roman general, was the leader on the other side. Caesar defeated Pompey in battle. Then he chased Pompey all the way to Egypt, where Pompey was killed.
When Caesar got to Egypt, he found that this country was also having a civil war. The princess Cleopatra was trying to take power away from her brother. Caesar decided to help Cleopatra. With his support, she became the Queen of Egypt. Caesar and Cleopatra became close friends and worked together to rule Egypt.

Caesar had big plans for Rome. He didn't think Rome was being run the right way. He wanted to change many things. He made the Senate pass new laws. He replaced the old calendar with the one we still use today. Did you know that the month of July is named for Julius Caesar?
Caesar wanted to do more, but he felt he needed more power. He got himself appointed dictator. At first, he was appointed dictator for only one year. That was not so unusual. The Romans had chosen dictators before during times of trouble. But a dictator was only supposed to rule for a short time. That was not what Caesar had in mind. He had himself appointed dictator for ten years. That upset many people. Later, Caesar had himself appointed dictator for life. That was really too much for some Romans.

        After Caesar won his battles in Gaul, he started marching back to Rome. The Roman senators were very worried about Caesar. They thought he might march into Rome and take over their government. The senators sent Caesar a message. They told him to stop and send his soldiers home. They ordered him not to cross the Rubicon River. If he crossed it, they said he would not be treated as a hero. Instead, he would be treated as a traitor and an enemy of Rome.
In the year 49 BC, Caesar made his choice. He crossed the Rubicon River with his army. He said in Latin, ""The die is cast."" That was his way of saying he knew he was taking a big risk. Crossing the Rubicon meant there was no turning back. He had to fight or lose everything.

Caesar's actions started a civil war. A civil war is when people from the same country fight against each other. Caesar was the leader on one side. Pompey, another famous Roman general, was the leader on the other side. Caesar defeated Pompey in battle. Then he chased Pompey all the way to Egypt, where Pompey was killed.
When Caesar got to Egypt, he found that this country was also having a civil war. The princess Cleopatra was trying to take power away from her brother. Caesar decided to help Cleopatra. With his support, she became the Queen of Egypt. Caesar and Cleopatra became close friends and worked together to rule Egypt.

Caesar had big plans for Rome. He didn't think Rome was being run the right way. He wanted to change many things. He made the Senate pass new laws. He replaced the old calendar with the one we still use today. Did you know that the month of July is named for Julius Caesar?
Caesar wanted to do more, but he felt he needed more power. He got himself appointed dictator. At first, he was appointed dictator for only one year. That was not so unusual. The Romans had chosen dictators before during times of trouble. But a dictator was only supposed to rule for a short time. That was not what Caesar had in mind. He had himself appointed dictator for ten years. That upset many people. Later, Caesar had himself appointed dictator for life. That was really too much for some Romans.

In the year 49 BC, Caesar made his choice. He crossed the Rubicon River with his army. He said in Latin, ""The die is cast."" That was his way of saying he knew he was taking a big risk. Crossing the Rubicon meant there was no turning back. He had to fight or lose everything.

---

Caesar's actions started a civil war. A civil war is when people from the same country fight against each other. Caesar was the leader on one side. Pompey, another famous Roman general, was the leader on the other side. Caesar defeated Pompey in battle. Then he chased Pompey all the way to Egypt, where Pompey was killed.
When Caesar got to Egypt, he found that this country was also having a civil war. The princess Cleopatra was trying to take power away from her brother. Caesar decided to help Cleopatra. With his support, she became the Queen of Egypt. Caesar and Cleopatra became close friends and worked together to rule Egypt.

---

Caesar had big plans for Rome. He didn't think Rome was being run the right way. He wanted to change many things. He made the Senate pass new laws. He replaced the old calendar with the one we still use today. Did you know that the month of July is named for Julius Caesar?
Caesar wanted to do more, but he felt he needed more power. He got himself appointed dictator. At first, he was appointed dictator for only one year. That was not so unusual. The Romans had chosen dictators before during times of trouble. But a dictator was only supposed to rule for a short time. That was not what Caesar had in mind. He had himself appointed dictator for ten years. That upset many people. Later, Caesar had himself appointed dictator for life. That was really too much for some Romans.

---

For hundreds of years, Rome had been a republic where people had a say in government. Now Caesar was setting himself up as a dictator forever. Maybe he even wanted to be a king. That was very upsetting to many Romans. They had gotten rid of kings hundreds of years earlier.
A group of Romans decided that Caesar was dangerous to their republic. They made a plan to kill him. These men were called conspirators. A conspirator is someone who makes secret plans with others. The conspirators stabbed Caesar to death in the Senate building. Some of the men who killed Caesar were people he thought were his friends. One of them, Brutus, was a man Caesar had treated almost like a son. Brutus said he didn't love Caesar any less, but he loved Rome and the Roman republic more.

        The men who killed Julius Caesar wanted to save the republic. But they did not succeed. After Caesar died, another civil war started. The man who won the war was called Augustus Caesar, or just Augustus.
Augustus was Caesar's adopted son. He agreed with Caesar that Rome needed to change. But Augustus was very smart. He knew that Romans loved their history and old ways. They would be angry if he changed everything at once. So Augustus did something clever. He made himself emperor and planned to rule until he died. This meant Rome was no longer a republic. But Augustus kept many old traditions. He let Romans keep the Senate and consuls. Still, everyone knew that Augustus was really in charge.

Augustus brought peace to Rome after many years of fighting. During his reign, he decided to reform the government and conquer new lands. He built amazing monuments and magnificent new buildings. These included temples, theaters, and bath houses. He also fixed old buildings and decorated them with fancy stone like marble. Augustus once said proudly that he ""found Rome brick and left it marble.""
One of the most famous buildings built during Augustus's time was the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built as a temple to honor all the Roman gods. The word parts ""pan"" means all and ""theo"" means gods. The Pantheon is a beautiful building with a round dome roof. The original building burned down in a fire, but the Pantheon standing today was built to replace it. Thousands of people visit it every day.

---

The Pantheon is just one example of great Roman architecture. Another famous building is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was built shortly after Augustus's reign. It is a huge, oval stadium where Romans went to watch people and animals fight. The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand people. Today the Colosseum is in ruins, but enough is left to show us what it looked like long ago.
Romans also loved watching chariot races. These exciting races were held in an even bigger stadium called the Circus Maximus. For Romans, a chariot race or a fight was great entertainment, just like a football game or movie is for us today.

Augustus was Caesar's adopted son. He agreed with Caesar that Rome needed to change. But Augustus was very smart. He knew that Romans loved their history and old ways. They would be angry if he changed everything at once. So Augustus did something clever. He made himself emperor and planned to rule until he died. This meant Rome was no longer a republic. But Augustus kept many old traditions. He let Romans keep the Senate and consuls. Still, everyone knew that Augustus was really in charge.

---

Augustus brought peace to Rome after many years of fighting. During his reign, he decided to reform the government and conquer new lands. He built amazing monuments and magnificent new buildings. These included temples, theaters, and bath houses. He also fixed old buildings and decorated them with fancy stone like marble. Augustus once said proudly that he ""found Rome brick and left it marble.""
One of the most famous buildings built during Augustus's time was the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built as a temple to honor all the Roman gods. The word parts ""pan"" means all and ""theo"" means gods. The Pantheon is a beautiful building with a round dome roof. The original building burned down in a fire, but the Pantheon standing today was built to replace it. Thousands of people visit it every day.

The Pantheon is just one example of great Roman architecture. Another famous building is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was built shortly after Augustus's reign. It is a huge, oval stadium where Romans went to watch people and animals fight. The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand people. Today the Colosseum is in ruins, but enough is left to show us what it looked like long ago.
Romans also loved watching chariot races. These exciting races were held in an even bigger stadium called the Circus Maximus. For Romans, a chariot race or a fight was great entertainment, just like a football game or movie is for us today.

The word parts ""pan"" means all and ""theo"" means gods. The Pantheon is a beautiful building with a round dome roof. The original building burned down in a fire, but the Pantheon standing today was built to replace it. Thousands of people visit it every day.

---

The Pantheon is just one example of great Roman architecture. Another famous building is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was built shortly after Augustus's reign. It is a huge, oval stadium where Romans went to watch people and animals fight. The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand people. Today the Colosseum is in ruins, but enough is left to show us what it looked like long ago.
Romans also loved watching chariot races. These exciting races were held in an even bigger stadium called the Circus Maximus. For Romans, a chariot race or a fight was great entertainment, just like a football game or movie is for us today.

---

The Romans also built roads and aqueducts. The roads helped people travel from all around the Empire. The aqueducts were special structures used to bring fresh water from the countryside into the city. Some of these aqueducts were not only useful but also very beautiful to look at.",,,,,How does paragraph 6 develop the main idea that Romans built structures to improve daily life?,MCQ,It explains that roads helped travel and aqueducts brought water to cities.,It proves that Augustus was the only Roman who built anything useful.,It shows that entertainment was more important than practical needs.,It describes how Romans decorated their buildings with expensive marble.,A,"Great job!

        Long ago in Rome, there was a slave named Androcles. He ran away from his master because he was treated badly. One night, Androcles found a cave in the mountains. He went inside the dark cave to hide and fell asleep on the cold ground.
In the middle of the night, a loud roaring sound woke him up. Androcles looked around in the darkness and saw something that scared him. A huge lion was coming into the cave! This was the lion's home. Androcles moved back against the cave wall. He thought the lion would kill him.
But then Androcles saw that something was wrong with the lion. The big cat was limping and roaring because it was hurt. The lion lay down and lifted up its front paw. It kept licking the paw over and over.

---

Androcles felt sorry for the lion. He decided to crouch down next to the hurt animal. The lion looked at him with sad eyes, like it was asking for help. Androcles looked at the paw and saw a big thorn stuck deep inside it. Very carefully, he reached out and pulled the thorn out of the lion's paw.
The lion purred and looked at Androcles with kind eyes. From that day on, they became the best of friends. Androcles learned to befriend the wild animal. They lived together in the cave for many months. They shared food and kept each other warm at night. The lion protected Androcles, and Androcles took care of the lion.

---

One day, Roman soldiers found Androcles hiding in the cave. The law said that runaway slaves must be punished. The soldiers captured Androcles and took him back to Rome. They put him in jail and gave him only water and old bread to eat.
After ten days, the guards told Androcles he would have to fight in the Colosseum. This was a huge building where Romans watched fights for fun. Runaway slaves were often forced to fight vicious wild animals or strong gladiators. Most slaves died in these fights. Androcles knew he would probably die, but he was brave.

---

When Androcles walked into the arena, thousands of Romans cheered loudly. They wanted to see a good fight. Then the guards let a lion into the arena. The crowd cheered even more because they thought the lion would kill Androcles.
But something amazing happened. This was the same lion that Androcles had helped! The lion ran to Androcles and began licking his face like a friendly dog. Androcles hugged his old friend and rubbed his belly. The crowd had never seen anything like this before.

        Long ago in Rome, there was a slave named Androcles. He ran away from his master because he was treated badly. One night, Androcles found a cave in the mountains. He went inside the dark cave to hide and fell asleep on the cold ground.
In the middle of the night, a loud roaring sound woke him up. Androcles looked around in the darkness and saw something that scared him. A huge lion was coming into the cave! This was the lion's home. Androcles moved back against the cave wall. He thought the lion would kill him.
But then Androcles saw that something was wrong with the lion. The big cat was limping and roaring because it was hurt. The lion lay down and lifted up its front paw. It kept licking the paw over and over.

Androcles felt sorry for the lion. He decided to crouch down next to the hurt animal. The lion looked at him with sad eyes, like it was asking for help. Androcles looked at the paw and saw a big thorn stuck deep inside it. Very carefully, he reached out and pulled the thorn out of the lion's paw.
The lion purred and looked at Androcles with kind eyes. From that day on, they became the best of friends. Androcles learned to befriend the wild animal.

        Long ago in Rome, there was a slave named Androcles. He ran away from his master because he was treated badly. One night, Androcles found a cave in the mountains. He went inside the dark cave to hide and fell asleep on the cold ground.
In the middle of the night, a loud roaring sound woke him up. Androcles looked around in the darkness and saw something that scared him. A huge lion was coming into the cave! This was the lion's home. Androcles moved back against the cave wall. He thought the lion would kill him.
But then Androcles saw that something was wrong with the lion. The big cat was limping and roaring because it was hurt. The lion lay down and lifted up its front paw. It kept licking the paw over and over.

Androcles felt sorry for the lion. He decided to crouch down next to the hurt animal. The lion looked at him with sad eyes, like it was asking for help. Androcles looked at the paw and saw a big thorn stuck deep inside it. Very carefully, he reached out and pulled the thorn out of the lion's paw.
The lion purred and looked at Androcles with kind eyes. From that day on, they became the best of friends. Androcles learned to befriend the wild animal. They lived together in the cave for many months. They shared food and kept each other warm at night. The lion protected Androcles, and Androcles took care of the lion.
