        There once was a poor boy named Aladdin. His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them.

""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place.
