        There once was a poor boy named Aladdin. His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

---

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

---

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place.

When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me.

""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

---

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

---

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp.

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp.

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there.

His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

""My lord,"" she said, ""my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter."" The Sultan laughed loudly. ""Your son and my daughter? That's silly!"" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought. ""I have never seen such beautiful gems!"" Then the Sultan said, ""Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.""

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.""What do you wish for?"" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, ""Take me out of this cave!"" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.""What is your wish?"" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food.

But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought. ""I have never seen such beautiful gems!"" Then the Sultan said, ""Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.""

Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end?

She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

---

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

---

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

In front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, ""Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!"" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. ""That was not there before,"" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

In front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, ""Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!"" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked.

Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. ""That was not there before,"" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash!

        Alice kept walking through Wonderland until she found a strange cat sitting on a tree branch. This was the Cheshire Cat, and he had a huge grin on his face. Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

---

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat. ""Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!""Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly. First his tail vanished, then his body, and finally everything was gone except his grin. The smile stayed floating in the air for a while after the rest of him had disappeared.""How curious!"" Alice thought to herself. ""A grin without a cat! I have never seen anything like that before!""

---

Alice continued walking until she came to a house. In front of the house was a large table set up for tea time. The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sitting at the table having tea. Between them sat a sleepy Dormouse. Even though the table was very big, all three of them were crowded together at just one corner.""No room! No room!"" they shouted when they saw Alice coming toward them.""There is plenty of room!"" Alice said angrily. She sat down in a big chair at the end of the table.""Have some lemonade,"" the March Hare offered.Alice looked around the whole table carefully.

        Alice kept walking through Wonderland until she found a strange cat sitting on a tree branch. This was the Cheshire Cat, and he had a huge grin on his face. Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat. ""Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!""Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly.

Alice thought to herself. ""A grin without a cat! I have never seen anything like that before!""

        Alice kept walking through Wonderland until she found a strange cat sitting on a tree branch. This was the Cheshire Cat, and he had a huge grin on his face. Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat.

She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

---

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat. ""Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!""Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly. First his tail vanished, then his body, and finally everything was gone except his grin. The smile stayed floating in the air for a while after the rest of him had disappeared.""How curious!"" Alice thought to herself. ""A grin without a cat! I have never seen anything like that before!""

---

Alice continued walking until she came to a house. In front of the house was a large table set up for tea time. The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sitting at the table having tea. Between them sat a sleepy Dormouse. Even though the table was very big, all three of them were crowded together at just one corner.""No room! No room!"" they shouted when they saw Alice coming toward them.""There is plenty of room!"" Alice said angrily. She sat down in a big chair at the end of the table.""Have some lemonade,"" the March Hare offered.Alice looked around the whole table carefully. ""I don't see any lemonade anywhere,"" she said.""There isn't any lemonade,"" the March Hare replied.""Then it was not very nice of you to offer it to me,"" Alice said with anger.""It was not very nice of you to sit down when nobody invited you,"" the March Hare shot back.

""This should be fun to solve!""""I think I can figure that out,"" she said out loud.""Do you really think you know the answer?"" asked the March Hare.""Yes, I do,"" said Alice confidently.""Then you should say exactly what you mean,"" the March Hare continued.""I do say what I mean.

""You might as well say that 'I see what I eat' means the same thing as 'I eat what I see!'""The sleepy Dormouse added, ""You might as well say that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same as 'I sleep when I breathe!'""The Mad Hatter turned back to Alice.

""What is the answer?""""I have no idea,"" said the Mad Hatter.""Neither do I,"" said the March Hare.Alice thought to herself, ""This is the strangest tea party I have ever been to in my whole life!""

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

---

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

---

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

Just at that moment, Alice woke up! She was lying on the river bank next to her sister. The sun was still shining brightly and it was a beautiful day. Alice was so excited to tell her sister about her amazing dream and all her adventures in Wonderland. Her sister enjoyed listening to all the wonderful stories.Alice's eyes sparkled as she told her sister about all the creatures she had met.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

---

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

Toad walked quickly to the stable yard. Rat followed him, but he did not look happy. There in the yard was a brand new travel wagon.

        Toad was very excited when Rat and Mole came to visit him. ""You must help me with something very important!"" Toad said with a big smile.""Do you want us to help you with your boat?"" asked Rat.""Oh no! Boating is silly!"" said Toad. He made a face like he had tasted something bad. ""I don't like boating anymore. It's just a waste of time. I feel sorry that you two still think about boats all the time. I found something much better to do! Come with me to the stable yard. You will see something amazing!""

Toad walked quickly to the stable yard. Rat followed him, but he did not look happy. There in the yard was a brand new travel wagon. It was painted bright yellow and green colors.""Look at this beautiful wagon!"" cried Toad. ""This is real life! We can travel on the open road!

The whole world is waiting for us! Come look inside. I planned everything myself!""Mole was very excited. He followed Toad up the steps into the wagon. But Rat stayed outside. He made an angry sound and put his hands in his pockets.

Inside the wagon were small beds and a table that could fold against the wall. There was a cooking stove, storage boxes, and bookshelves. Toad even had a birdcage with a bird inside.

They had not walked very far when they heard footsteps behind them. Toad caught up with them. He put his paw inside each of their arms. ""Now, look here Toad!"" said Rat in a sharp voice. ""As soon as we get to the town, you must go straight to the police station. You must see if they know anything about that motor car. You must find out who owns it.

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

---

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

---

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!

Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals.

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

---

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.
Warm-blooded animals can live in many different places, but cold-blooded animals can only live in certain places. Cold-blooded animals do not need to eat as much as warm-blooded animals.

You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.

Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals changes with the outside temperature. They become hot when it is hot outside and cold when it is cold outside. But cold-blooded animals must also keep a constant temperature for their bodies to work right.
Cold-blooded animals do not use energy from their bodies to stay warm or cool. Instead, they use things around them. Crocodiles stay in water or mud to stay cool on hot days. If they need to warm up on cooler days, they lie in the sun.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! In the last chapter, you learned how scientists put living things into groups called kingdoms. You learned about animals and plants. You also learned that animals get put into smaller groups too.
Today, you will learn more about the animal kingdom. There are many kinds of animals that are different from each other. Scientists look at these differences to put animals into groups.

---

Many animals like cats, mice, rats, cows, elephants, tigers, and even people belong to a group called mammals. So you and I are mammals! All mammals have hair, but some have more hair than others. You have to get very close to an elephant to see its hair, but it is still a mammal. Another thing about mammals is that they give birth to live babies. Mammal babies start breathing, moving, and looking for food right when they are born. Mammal mothers make milk to feed their babies. This is a very important thing that all mammals do.
Do you think a crocodile is a mammal? The answer is no! Here's why. Crocodiles have hard scales, not hair or fur. Crocodiles lay eggs and baby crocodiles come out of those eggs. A baby crocodile does not get milk from its mother. Its first meal might be a bug. Later, it will eat bigger animals.
Crocodiles belong to a different group of animals called reptiles. Snakes, lizards, and turtles are reptiles too.

---

Scientists also put animals into groups based on how they control their body temperature. All animals need to keep a constant temperature inside their bodies. This means the temperature stays the same. If an animal gets too hot or too cold, its body will not work right. The animal may get sick or even die.
Mammals are warm-blooded animals. When warm-blooded animals are in a cold place, they use energy from food to keep their bodies warm. Some warm-blooded animals shiver to stay warm. When they shiver, their bodies make heat.
When warm-blooded animals are somewhere hot, their bodies work differently to cool off. Some warm-blooded animals, like people, sweat to stay cool. Dogs pant to stay cool. Other warm-blooded animals drink lots of water to cool off. Did you know that cows need to drink almost a bathtub full of water every day?

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! Scientists who study animals put them into different groups. They look at many things about animals. Some scientists check if animals have hair or scales on their skin. They see if animals have live babies or lay eggs. They also check if mothers feed milk to their babies. Scientists want to know if animals are warm-blooded or cold-blooded too.
One very important thing scientists study is the animal's backbone. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Humans are vertebrates too! Put your hand on the back of your neck. Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.

---

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

---

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.
Some very interesting invertebrates live in the sea. Lobsters, shrimp, and crabs do not have a backbone. The giant octopus is an invertebrate as well. Have you ever seen a jellyfish or a starfish? They are also invertebrates. All of these animals do not have a backbone or spinal cord.",,,,,Why do scientists study whether animals have a backbone?,MCQ,Scientists use backbones to group animals into categories.,Scientists want to see which animals are the biggest.,Scientists need to count how many bones animals have.,Scientists want to know how fast animals can run.,A,"Great job!

One very important thing scientists study is the animal's backbone. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Humans are vertebrates too! Put your hand on the back of your neck. Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.

Some scientists check if animals have hair or scales on their skin. They see if animals have live babies or lay eggs. They also check if mothers feed milk to their babies. Scientists want to know if animals are warm-blooded or cold-blooded too.
One very important thing scientists study is the animal's backbone. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Humans are vertebrates too! Put your hand on the back of your neck. Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.

---

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

---

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.
Some very interesting invertebrates live in the sea. Lobsters, shrimp, and crabs do not have a backbone. The giant octopus is an invertebrate as well. Have you ever seen a jellyfish or a starfish? They are also invertebrates. All of these animals do not have a backbone or spinal cord.",,,,,The final section of the passage gives readers information about,MCQ,the different types of vertebrates found in the animal kingdom,how scientists decide which animals belong in different groups,why backbones are important for protecting the spinal cord,animals that do not have backbones and examples of these animals,D,"Good try! That part talks about vertebrates, but the final section is about ""animals without a backbone"" and gives examples like insects and spiders.","Nice thinking, but that's from the beginning of the story. The final section tells about ""animals without a backbone"" and lists examples like jellyfish.","Not quite! That detail comes earlier in the passage.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.
Along the way, they hope that grizzly bears or people fishing will not catch them first. Salmon happen to be one of the tastiest fish of all!",,,,,Which fact about salmon is clear from the information in the passage?,MCQ,Salmon are the only fish that travel in schools.,Salmon live only in fresh water their whole lives.,Salmon return to the same stream where they were born.,Salmon use maps to find their way home.,C,"Good try!

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.

        Hello! Rattenborough here again! You have learned that scientists study animals. They put animals into different groups like mammals and reptiles. Today you will learn about another group of animals - fish.
Fish are aquatic animals. This means they live their whole lives underwater. Most fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes when the water gets warmer or cooler. Fish are also animals with backbones. They are the largest group of animals with backbones on Earth. Since most of our planet is covered with water, it makes sense that fish are everywhere.
Fish lay their eggs underwater. They also eat and sleep under the water. Fish do not sleep the same way people do. Fish cannot close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. When they sleep, they float around or find a safe place to hide and rest.

---

Like all animals, fish need to breathe oxygen. But fish do not have lungs like people do. They cannot breathe air like we can. Instead, fish have special body parts called gills right behind their heads. The gills take oxygen out of the water so fish can breathe. But gills only work in water. They cannot take oxygen from the air. A fish will die very quickly if it is taken out of water.
Fish have scales that cover their skin. Scales are small, round, and smooth pieces. They protect the fish's skin and help them move easily through water. Fish also use different fins on their bodies and their tails to swim. The fins help them glide through water and change direction quickly.

---

Most fish live in salt water because most water on Earth is salty. Fish that live in the warm ocean are very colorful. They look like an artist painted beautiful patterns on their bodies. Many fish also live in fresh water like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Some fish travel together in groups called a school. One type of fish that travels in a school is salmon. Salmon live in both salt water and fresh water. Some salmon are born in fresh water streams and rivers. After about one year, they swim to the ocean where they live for one to five years. Then they migrate back to the exact same stream where they were born. They lay their eggs and start the life cycle all over again.

---

Salmon do not use a map to find their way back home. Most scientists think they use their strong sense of smell to find their way. They swim upstream against the river's flow. Sometimes they swim hundreds of miles. They jump over waterfalls and rocks to get back to the same stream where they were born. They work very hard to reach their home to lay their eggs.

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

---

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.
A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water.

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

---

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds. When amphibians hibernate, they can survive for many months without eating or moving. They use fat stored in their bodies to stay alive.
A toad's life starts as one of thousands of soft, slimy eggs. The mother toad lays her eggs near the shore of a pond, lake, or quiet stream. But most of these eggs will never hatch. Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water.

Fish and other animals will eat them first. If the eggs move away from shore into bright sunlight, they will dry out and die.

---

Only a few hundred eggs out of thousands will hatch into tadpoles. A tadpole is very fragile and small. Its young body has mainly a mouth, a tail, and gills. Tadpoles live in water and use gills to breathe underwater, just like fish do.
After some time, tadpoles start swimming around and eating tiny water plants. Tadpoles like to stay together in groups, similar to schools of fish. But this makes it easier for other animals to catch and eat them. Most tadpoles become food for fish and other creatures.
If a tadpole can survive for about a month, amazing changes begin to happen. Skin starts to grow over its gills. After six to nine weeks, the tadpole grows little legs. As its body changes, it starts to look less like a water animal and more like a land animal.

---

After a few months, the young toad leaves the water and moves onto land. It might still have a small tail, but that will disappear soon. By this time, its gills have changed into lungs. Now the toad breathes air instead of getting oxygen from water like fish do. Soon it becomes a full-grown adult toad that hops around on land. Adult amphibians are carnivores. This means they eat insects, small reptiles, and even mice.
Adult toads are still great swimmers and can swim underwater. But they cannot use their lungs to breathe underwater anymore. Instead, their thin, wet skin can absorb oxygen right from the water around them.
Amphibians are truly amazing animals. They are the only animals that have both gills and lungs during their lives. As adults, they live on land but still lay their eggs in water. Now you can see why the Latin meaning of amphibian makes perfect sense!",,,,,Section 3 is mainly about,MCQ,why tadpoles stay in groups,how tadpoles are born from eggs,how tadpoles live and begin to change,when tadpoles become adult toads,C,"Nice thinking, but this section doesn't explain why tadpoles stay in groups.

        Hello again from your friend Rattenborough! Today we will learn about a special group of animals. These animals can live in water and on land. This group is called amphibians. The word amphibian comes from Latin words that mean ""both sides of life.""
There are three main types of amphibians. Frogs and toads make up the biggest group. Salamanders and newts are another group. The third group looks like big snakes because they have no legs. We don't know much about this last group because they live underground most of the time.

Let's look at how an American toad grows and changes during its life. Like all amphibians, toads are cold-blooded. This means their body temperature changes when the weather gets hot or cold. When winter comes, some amphibians hibernate. Some toads dig deep holes in the ground. Other amphibians like frogs bury themselves in mud at the bottom of ponds.

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

---

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.
Crocodiles have the most powerful bite of all animals. Their bites are ten times stronger than a great white shark's bite. But it is easy to hold a crocodile's mouth closed because they use weak muscles to open their mouths. Even a third grader might be able to hold a crocodile's jaw shut!",,,,,The author of this passage would most likely agree that,MCQ,All reptiles are dangerous and should be avoided.,Most reptiles are not harmful to people.,Snakes are the only reptiles worth studying.,People should never go near any reptile.,B,"Good try!

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

---

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

---

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.
Crocodiles have the most powerful bite of all animals. Their bites are ten times stronger than a great white shark's bite. But it is easy to hold a crocodile's mouth closed because they use weak muscles to open their mouths. Even a third grader might be able to hold a crocodile's jaw shut!",,,,,"Based on the bolded words in paragraph 2, what can readers learn about the black mamba?",MCQ,It is the longest snake in Africa.,It can cause death in less than 20 minutes.,It is more dangerous than rattlesnakes.,It lives in water like the water moccasin.,B,"Good try!

        Hi again, it's Rattenborough! You have already learned about reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with backbones. They live on land and in water like amphibians. But reptiles have lungs from the time they are born, not gills like amphibians.
Reptiles lay eggs with soft or hard shells. They put their eggs on land. Some snakes keep eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. A few reptiles give birth to live babies. Many animals are reptiles. These include crocodiles, alligators, turtles, snakes, and lizards.

---

Some people think reptiles are scary, mainly snakes. Most reptiles will not hurt people. But some reptiles can be dangerous. The black mamba is the deadliest snake in the world. This long, poisonous snake lives in Africa. When a mamba bites, it will inject venom into its victim. The venom can kill any animal, even a human, in less than 20 minutes!
Other dangerous snakes live in the United States. Rattlesnakes have rattles on their tails that shake and make noise. Copperheads have triangle-shaped heads and dark stripes. They live in rocky, wooded places. They only bite humans if people attack them or startle them. The water moccasin lives in water and is hard to see. This snake has a dangerous bite but rarely attacks people. If you live in southern states like Florida or Louisiana, you might see one in swamps or shallow lakes.

---

Many people think snakes feel slimy, but reptiles have thick, dry, scaly skin. Reptiles are known for shedding their skin. They molt, or shed their skin, several times during their lives. Snakes shed their skin in one big piece when they grow too big for their old skin.
The biggest reptile is the saltwater crocodile. It lives mainly in Australia and parts of India and Asia. Male saltwater crocodiles can grow to be 20 feet long or more! They rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is very dangerous.
Crocodiles have the most powerful bite of all animals. Their bites are ten times stronger than a great white shark's bite.

        Hello! It's Rattenborough again! You have learned about many animal groups. You know about mammals, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. Do you remember their different traits? Fish are the largest group of animals with backbones. Today we will talk about the second largest group—birds.
Birds belong to their own special group. Birds are very adaptive, which means they can live in many different places. You can find birds in hot deserts and in the coldest places on Earth. Many birds love forests. Some birds live near the ocean. If you go out on a boat near land, you might see sea birds like seagulls flying around.

---

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

---

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

---

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.
Birds are famous for their beautiful songs. They sing to attract other birds and to mark their territory. Sometimes birds seem to sing just because they are happy. Maybe they sing to remind us how wonderful and amazing the animal kingdom really is!",,,,,Why do many birds fly to new places in late fall?,MCQ,to look for different types of food,to move from cold to warm places,to find better nesting materials,to build new homes for their babies,B,"Good try!

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded. Many birds move to new places when seasons change. In late fall, they fly together in groups called flocks. They fly from cold places to warm places. Then in spring, they fly back home again. Birds are the only animals that can fly like airplanes, except for some insects and bats.
All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly. Penguins are well-known birds that cannot fly. But penguins are amazing swimmers instead! Ostriches are the biggest birds of all. They cannot fly either, but they can run very fast. They also lay the world's largest eggs.
All birds have two legs and a mouth called a beak. Birds do not have teeth. The most important thing about birds is that they all have feathers. Feathers help birds fly and stay warm. Bird feathers come in many colors and sizes. A bird's feathers are also called plumage. Peacocks have the most beautiful plumage of all birds. They like to show off by spreading their long, colorful feathers.

Most birds build nests for their homes. Many birds make their own nests high up in trees or thick bushes. They use pieces from nature like twigs and plant parts to build their nests. Other birds make nests inside tree holes. Some bird nests are made of mud.
Most birds lay eggs in their nests. Some birds lay many eggs and some lay only one or two. The nest must be safe to protect the eggs from bad weather and other animals. Birds sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. When baby birds are born, they need lots of food. Mother and father birds fly out to find food. They bring it back and put the food right into each baby's beak.

Many birds eat both plants and animals. Some birds eat seeds and berries. Some eat insects. Great blue herons eat fish. Hawks eat small mammals. Tiny hummingbirds eat sweet nectar from flowers. All birds need to drink water too.

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

---

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

---

Mammals come in many different shapes and sizes. Some swim in oceans, some fly in the sky, and some walk on land.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do. But they still have hair, make milk, and have all the other things that make them mammals. These strange creatures are very hard to find because they are so rare!

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do.

Another surprising mammal is the bat. Bats can fly like birds, but they are not birds at all. Bats have fur instead of feathers. Their wings are made of skin flaps, not feathers like bird wings. Bats give birth to live babies and make milk for them. This is why scientists say bats are mammals, not birds.
Here is a very interesting fact about mammals. Almost all mammals give birth to live babies. But two special mammals lay eggs! The duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater lay eggs like birds do.

        Hello! I am Rattenborough, and I want to tell you about my favorite animal group - mammals! I am a mammal myself. Do you know what makes an animal a mammal? Mammals have hair on their bodies. They give birth to live babies and feed milk to their young. Mammals breathe air with their lungs. They are also warm-blooded and have backbones.
Most scientists think mammals are the smartest animals on Earth. All animals communicate in different ways. Dogs bark and wag their tails to talk. Cows make mooing sounds. Cats can meow or roar. But mammals use the most complex ways to talk to each other. Humans use language to speak with words. They also use their faces and hands to share ideas. Some apes and chimpanzees have learned sign language to talk with their hands.

Two amazing mammals live in the ocean. You might not know that dolphins and whales are mammals because they swim like fish. But these ocean mammals cannot breathe underwater like fish do. Fish have gills, but dolphins and whales have blowholes on top of their heads. They swim to the surface and poke their heads up to breathe air.
Whales and dolphins have a special way to find things in the dark ocean water. They send out sound waves called sonar. These sound waves travel through the water and hit objects. Then the sounds bounce back as an echo. When the whale or dolphin hears the echo come back, it can tell how big something is and how far away it is. They also use these sounds to talk to each other! Like all mammals, dolphins and whales give birth to live babies and feed them milk. They have hair and thick skin that keeps them warm and safe from animals that want to eat them called predators.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

---

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows? Maybe you will be the first to find a feathered fish or a flying snail. It may sound silly now, but a hundred years ago, nobody knew that whales talked to each other.

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!

Today, there are about one million scientists around the world studying animals. Every one of them spends their day watching, testing, and finding new information. This adds to our knowledge about the world we live in.
If you want to be a zoologist when you grow up, there is plenty to study. You never know when someone will learn something that changes how we think about the world. Who knows?

        Hello, Rattenborough here again! You have been learning about how scientists study living things. Scientists put all living things into five big groups called kingdoms. You have learned how animals are sorted into smaller groups within the animal kingdom.
The scientists who study animals are called zoologists. Zoologists observe animals to see how they are the same and different. To observe means to watch carefully and learn. For example, zoologists found out that some animals are warm-blooded and some are cold-blooded.
Zoologists also group animals by whether they have a backbone or not. Animals with a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. There are five groups of vertebrates. These groups are fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates.

---

Zoologists study other parts of animals too. They study animal body parts and how they are alike or different. All animals need to breathe oxygen. But they have different body parts called organs that help them breathe. An organ is a body part that does a special job. Fish and young amphibians have gills. Gills are organs that help them get oxygen from water. Mammals, reptiles, and adult amphibians use lungs. Lungs are organs that get oxygen from air.
Zoologists also study how animal babies are born and cared for. Do you remember which group of animal mothers feed their babies milk from their own bodies? That's right - mammals!

---

Everything we know about animals was discovered by scientists. Many scientists have been interested in animals for a very long time. A Greek man named Aristotle first grouped animals over 2,000 years ago. Aristotle wrote a book called A History of Animals. As scientists learned more about animals, they changed how animals are grouped. There is still much to learn about animals. After all, there are thousands of new animals that scientists have not found yet!
Every day, scientists learn new facts about animals. Scientists even find new animals they didn't know exist. To exist means to be real or to live somewhere. There is always new knowledge to discover when you study living things! Knowledge means facts and information that we learn.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

---

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.

She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild.

Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

---

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

---

More importantly, Goodall discovered that chimps were very intelligent. Being intelligent means being smart and able to learn new things. She watched them making and using tools! Before that, people thought humans were the only animals that made and used tools. Goodall saw chimps using blades of grass and sticks as tools. Chimps like to eat termites, which are insects like ants. To catch these tasty insects, a chimp would stick a blade of grass into a termite hole. The termites would crawl onto the grass. Then, the chimp would pull out the grass and eat all the termites.
Goodall gave names to all the chimps she studied. She learned that chimps show many of the same feelings as people. They can feel happy, sad, and angry. This behavior helped people understand that chimps are very special animals.

Goodall is more than a scientist. She is also an activist. An activist is someone who works hard to solve problems and change things in the world. Goodall works to protect chimpanzees and their homes in the wild. She teaches others about human damage to animal homes. This damage includes hunting and pollution. Pollution happens when harmful things get into the air, water, or land where animals live.

        Jane Goodall is a very famous primatologist. A primatologist is a scientist who studies a group of animals called primates. Primates are mammals that include humans, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has spent her whole life studying chimpanzees. She watches their behavior, which means how they act and what they do each day. Her discoveries have made her one of the best known scientists in the world.
Goodall was born in 1934 in London, England. When she was a little girl, her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. It looked so real that people who visited her house were afraid of it, but she loved it! This toy helped her dream about studying real chimpanzees someday.

When Goodall was 23 years old, she went to Africa. She began studying chimpanzees with a well-known scientist named Louis Leakey. After a year of working in Africa, Goodall went back to England. She studied at the University of Cambridge. Can you guess what her favorite subject was? Chimpanzees!
After finishing school, Goodall returned to Africa. She spent the next 45 years studying chimpanzees in the wild. Her discoveries during those years completely changed the way people think about primates. Before Goodall's work, people thought chimpanzees were herbivores. An herbivore is an animal that only eats plants. She discovered that chimps also eat meat, making them omnivores. An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat.

        Oceans are very deep bodies of water. People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.
The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

---

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

---

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

---

The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

---

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

        Oceans are very deep bodies of water. People cannot go very deep into the ocean, even with special equipment. Divers use scuba gear to breathe underwater. This includes a tank of oxygen and other tools. But there is still a limit to how deep anyone can go.
The deeper you go, the more water pressure you feel. This happens because of the weight of all the water around you. You can feel this pressure when you swim to the bottom of a pool. If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish.

If you stay on the pool floor for a few seconds, you will feel pressure in your ears. In the ocean, this pressure gets much stronger as you go deeper.

How deep are oceans? It depends on where you are in the world. Some parts are only a few yards deep. Other parts can be around 10,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean is more than six miles down! The water pressure there is incredibly strong. It would feel like 3,300 elephants dropped on you at the same time. A person would be crushed to the size of an ant or smaller.
No land animals can survive the water pressure of the deep ocean. Most fish cannot either. However, there is lots of life down there! How do we know this? Scientists have created special underwater vehicles called submersibles that can go very deep. A submersible is different from a regular submarine. Some submersibles can carry one or two people. Others are controlled from the surface using remote controls.

---

With lights and cameras, a submersible can explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Scientists made the first submersible about 50 years ago. They have been discovering amazing fish ever since! Fish that live deep in the ocean are unlike any other creatures. They have very thick bodies to handle all that water pressure.
No sunlight reaches the bottom of the ocean, so it is completely dark down there. Many deep-sea fish actually glow! Lantern fish are the most common deep-sea fish. There are billions of them swimming in the deep ocean. The anglerfish is one of the strangest creatures on Earth. It has a huge mouth and scary teeth. It also has something like a built-in flashlight on its head to talk to other fish.

        Amphibians are special animals that live in two places. They spend part of their lives in water and part on land. When they are babies, they have gills like fish. This helps them breathe underwater. Later, they grow lungs so they can breathe air on land. Tree frogs are one kind of amphibian. They are different because they spend most of their time up in trees.
The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

---

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

---

Like other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it. Their favorite spot is on a tree branch that has fallen into a pond. Tree frogs have been around for a very long time. They lived on Earth even before dinosaurs! You can find different types of tree frogs in North America, South America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.
Most tree frogs like a warm, wet climate. If you live where tree frogs are found, you are lucky! In the summer, you can fall asleep listening to the sounds of many tree frogs singing together.

The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

Like other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it. Their favorite spot is on a tree branch that has fallen into a pond. Tree frogs have been around for a very long time. They lived on Earth even before dinosaurs!

The American green tree frog lives in the southeastern United States. These frogs are very small. A typical tree frog is only about two inches long. But they can make a lot of noise when many of them get together. If you live in the southern United States near water and trees, you might hear their gentle chirps on summer nights.

---

American tree frogs can be lime green or yellow in color. Their most special feature is their long toes. Each toe has a suction cup at the end. These suction cups help tree frogs stick to anything they want to climb. They can even stick to windows! Tree frogs like to stay up in trees, so you will probably hear them before you see them. They only come down to lay their eggs. They are most likely to come to the ground after heavy rain, when everything is wet.
If you do see a tree frog, don't be scared! They are friendly animals. They are easy to catch too. If you catch one, it might sit on your hand or crawl on your back. You will probably only find them at night because they are nocturnal. This means they sleep during the day and are awake at night. They eat small bugs like crickets and moths.

Like other amphibians, American green tree frogs lay their eggs in or near water. Most of them like to put their eggs very close to water, but not right in it. Their favorite spot is on a tree branch that has fallen into a pond. Tree frogs have been around for a very long time. They lived on Earth even before dinosaurs! You can find different types of tree frogs in North America, South America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

---

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

---

You never want a Komodo dragon to bite you or even lick you! Their saliva is full of dangerous germs that can make people very sick. The saliva in their mouth contains bacteria that can be deadly.

        You have probably heard stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly around scaring people. A brave knight usually comes to save the day in these fairy tales. But real fire-breathing dragons never existed. However, there is one real dragon that lives today: the Komodo dragon. This dragon does not breathe fire or fly. It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

---

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

It is just a very big reptile that can be quite dangerous. These animals have attacked people before, so you need to be very careful around them.
These special dragons get their name from the island of Komodo. This remote island is part of a country called Indonesia. You can also find Komodo dragons on four or five other islands nearby. But they are very rare animals. They like to live in hot, dry places. Each dragon digs a burrow in the ground that is two to three feet deep. Like most reptiles, they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in their burrow.

---

A Komodo dragon can grow as big as a crocodile or even bigger! They can weigh up to 150 pounds and grow over ten feet long from head to tail. The biggest one ever found weighed 370 pounds. That is as heavy as about six third-grade students put together!
Like many reptiles, Komodo dragons cannot hear or see very well. But they have a very strong sense of smell. Here is something amazing: they do not use their nostril to smell things. Instead, they use their tongue! They stick out their tongue to smell food that is several miles away. This works best when the wind blows the smell toward them.

---

Komodo dragons are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Most of the time, they eat dead animals they find. But when they cannot find dead animals, they hunt for fresh food. They have very sharp claws and teeth. When they need to, they can move quite fast. They are the only lizards that can attack and eat animals bigger than themselves. They might hunt goats, deer, and even huge water buffalo!
Young Komodo dragons eat insects, small mammals, and birds. They climb trees to catch their prey. They will eat anything they can catch with their claws, as long as it has meat.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

---

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

---

One beaver family can change the land around them in big ways. Their dams make the water in rivers rise higher. This floods the land nearby and creates a swamp called a wetland. A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.
Beavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave. Beavers are also very territorial. This means they don't want other beavers living in their space. They want to keep all the tasty tree bark for themselves!

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes.

A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.
Beavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.

A wetland is a special place where land and water mix together. Many birds, fish, and insects need wetlands to live. However, people who live nearby might not like the flooding that beavers cause.
Beavers don't stay in one place very long. When they eat all the good tree bark in an area, they move down the river to start over. But the wetland they made often stays there long after they leave. Beavers are also very territorial. This means they don't want other beavers living in their space. They want to keep all the tasty tree bark for themselves! They will fight other beavers who try to move into their area.

        Beavers are special mammals that do important work in nature. These animals have two main features that help them survive. First, they have long, sharp teeth that they use to gnaw down trees. To gnaw means to bite and chew on something hard. Second, they have flat, wide tails that help them swim fast in the water. Their tails also work like alarm bells. When a beaver sees danger, it slaps its tail hard on the water to warn other beavers.
Beavers live near ponds and lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Today, it is hard to find beavers in the wild. Long ago, people hunted so many beavers that they almost disappeared forever. This is called extinction. People wanted beaver pelts, which are the furry skins of animals. They used these pelts to make warm coats and hats. Even today, some people still hunt beavers or think they cause problems.

Beavers are the second biggest rodent in the world. A rodent is a type of animal with big front teeth, like mice, rats, and hamsters. People often say ""busy as a beaver"" because these animals work all the time. They spend most of their day in the water building things. Beavers are famous for making dams across rivers and streams. They build these dams to make the water deeper, which keeps them safe from bears and other animals that might hurt them.
When beavers sense danger, they can dive underwater and hold their breath for up to 15 minutes! They move slowly on land, but they swim very well. After building a dam, beavers make homes called lodges. These lodges are big piles of sticks and mud. Beavers use their strong teeth to gnaw down trees of all sizes. Then they eat the bark from the trees and use the leftover wood to build their dams and lodges.
