His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. \"Tell me, young man,\" said the stranger. \"Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?\"\"Yes, I am,\" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. \"My dear nephew!\" he cried out. \"Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!\"\n\n---\n\nAladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. \"Come with me today,\" he said to the boy. \"I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city.\" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.\"Go gather some dry sticks,\" the magician told Aladdin. \"We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.\"Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.\n\n---\n\n\"Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,\" said the magician. \"It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.\"Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.\"Take this special ring,\" said the magician. \"It will keep you safe from any harm.\" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.\"Give me your hand, Uncle,\" Aladdin called out. \"Help me climb out!\"\"First, hand me the lamp,\" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. \"I cannot reach it right now,\" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him \"richer than any king in the world.\"What does this phrase mean?\n- A) Aladdin will have more money than he can count\n- B) Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom\n- C) Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave\n- D) Aladdin will meet kings from other countries\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.4.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What causes the magician to trap Aladdin in the cave?\n- A) Aladdin doesn't give him the lamp right away.\n- B) Aladdin won't to go into the cave.\n- C) Aladdin takes too many gems from the cave.\n- D) Aladdin breaks the magic ring on his finger.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 3, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

The text states 'The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.' This phrase describes how the ground magically opened up to show the entrance to the cave where the treasure was hidden. This is nonliteral language showing magical action.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the text mentions 'Thunder crashed and rumbled,' there was no earthquake. The earth splitting open was caused by the magician's spell, not by natural earthquake forces. Reread paragraph 3 to see what caused the earth to open.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician did not physically dig. The text shows he used magic words and perfumes to make the earth open by itself. This phrase uses nonliteral language to describe a magical event, not physical digging. Look for clues about how the magician used magic.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Although the text mentions the sky turning dark, there is no mention of lightning striking the ground. The earth split open because of the magician's spell, not because of lightning.

The phrase 'sweet-smelling' is a descriptive term that tells us the perfumes had a pleasant, nice odor. The text uses this literal description to help readers imagine what the perfumes were like. When something is 'sweet-smelling,' it means it has an agreeable, pleasant scent.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. 'Sweet-smelling' describes the nice odor of the perfumes, not what they were made from. The word 'sweet' here refers to a pleasant smell, not to sugar or honey ingredients. In this context, 'sweet' is being used to describe smell, not taste.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the perfumes may have been expensive, 'sweet-smelling' does not tell us about cost. This phrase only describes how the perfumes smelled - that they had a pleasant odor. The text does not give us information about the price of the perfumes.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text does not tell us where the perfumes came from. 'Sweet-smelling' only describes the pleasant smell of the perfumes, not their source or ingredients.

The word 'impatient' means unable to wait calmly, and 'could not wait any longer' emphasizes he had run out of patience. This nonliteral phrase reveals the magician's personality trait - he was so eager for the lamp that he couldn't control his emotions. This lack of patience caused him to make the bad decision to trap Aladdin.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the phrase mentions waiting, it describes the magician's emotional state (impatience), not the actual amount of time that passed. The text shows this happened quickly during their conversation, not after many hours. Focus on what 'impatient' tells us about his personality.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text does not mention the magician worrying about other people finding the lamp. The phrase 'impatient' describes his inability to wait calmly for Aladdin to hand over the lamp, not fear about others. His problem was lack of patience, not worry about competition.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. There is no mention of the magician needing to leave for North Africa. 'Impatient' describes his personality trait of not being able to wait calmly, not a need to travel. His impatience was about getting the lamp right away, not about travel plans.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 5 character trait description - differs from reference which asks about wealth phrase in paragraph 4\",\"quality_verification\":{\"homogeneity_check\":\"all choices are explanations of what the impatience phrase reveals\",\"specificity_check\":\"all at similar detail level providing interpretations\",\"length_check\":\"A:11 words, B:10 words, C:10 words, D:9 words - within 10%\",\"semantic_distance_check\":\"distinct explanations: emotional control vs time duration vs worry vs travel urgency\",\"single_correct_check\":\"only A correctly identifies the personality/emotional meaning\",\"diversity_check\":\"targets paragraph 5 character description - completely different from reference and other variants, uses 'what does...show about' stem\"}},{\"question\":\"What does the magician mean when he says the treasure will 'make you richer than any king in the world' but then only asks Aladdin to bring back a lamp?\",\"option_1\":\"The lamp itself is the most valuable treasure, not the gems\",\"option_2\":\"Kings do not own as much treasure as people think\",\"option_3\":\"Aladdin should bring all the treasures, not just the lamp\",\"option_4\":\"The magician wants to share the treasure equally with Aladdin\",\"correct_answer\":\"A\",\"option_1_explanation\":\"Correct! This question requires you to compare what the magician promises (all the treasure) with what he actually wants (just the lamp). The magician's intense focus on getting only the lamp - even trapping Aladdin when he won't hand it over immediately - shows that the lamp is the real treasure. The phrase about riches was meant to motivate Aladdin, but the magician's true interest is the lamp's magic power, not the other treasures.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The phrase 'richer than any king' is used to emphasize great wealth, not to make a statement about what kings actually own. The key is understanding why the magician asks only for the lamp after promising Aladdin all the riches. Focus on what the magician truly values most.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician specifically tells Aladdin to bring back the lamp and says 'Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.' He never asks for all the treasures. The question asks you to figure out what this reveals about which item is most valuable to him.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician's actions show he does not want to share - he traps Aladdin in the cave when he doesn't get the lamp immediately!

The text clearly states: 'She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother.' This shows that Aladdin's mother is surprised because this is new information - if her husband had a brother, she would have expected to know about it. Her surprise is based on this contradiction between what she knew and what the stranger claims.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text does not describe what the stranger looks like or compare his appearance to Aladdin's father. Her surprise is not about physical appearance. Reread paragraph 2 to find the specific reason the text gives for her surprise.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. At this point in the story, Aladdin's mother does not know the stranger is a magician. The text tells us readers that he is a magician, but she doesn't discover this. Her surprise happens when he first arrives, before any magic. Look for what surprises her when she first meets him.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While Aladdin did bring someone home, this is not why she felt surprised. The text gives a specific reason for her surprise that relates to information about her husband's family.

The text shows a clear cause-and-effect sequence: Aladdin says he cannot reach the lamp right now, then 'The magician grew very angry' because 'the impatient magician could not wait any longer.' His anger and impatience directly cause him to speak the spell. This demonstrates how the magician's character traits (impatience, anger) contribute to the sequence of events leading to Aladdin being trapped.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text does not mention the magician fearing Aladdin would steal the lamp. The text specifically states the magician 'grew very angry' because Aladdin wouldn't hand it over immediately, and that 'the impatient magician could not wait any longer.' His action was caused by impatience and anger, not fear. Look for the emotions the text actually describes.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician gave Aladdin the ring earlier to keep him safe, and there is no mention of testing it. The text clearly explains that the magician's anger and impatience about not getting the lamp immediately caused him to trap Aladdin. Reread paragraph 5 to see what motivated the magician's spell.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text shows the magician 'only cared about getting the magic lamp' - he was not concerned about the gems.

The text explains the sequence: 'Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.'

The text specifically states the magician 'only cared about getting the magic lamp,' not the gems.

Reread paragraph 5 to see what the magician truly cared about and how the gems actually created the problem.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The bag did not block the entrance. The problem was that the bag's weight made Aladdin unable to climb out by himself - 'he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.' Later, the magician used magic to close the stone. Look for how the gems' weight affected Aladdin's ability to climb.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. There is no mention of gems creating light or blinding anyone.

The story does not teach that children should always obey adults. In fact, Aladdin's obedience to the magician leads to trouble!

While the magician is impatient, the story's message is not about patience.

This detail is key to understanding Aladdin's motivation. The text establishes that 'Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter' after his father died, showing the family was poor and struggling.

This requires synthesizing evidence from throughout the story. The magician made generous offers (help Aladdin become a merchant, make him richer than any king), showed kindness (hugged him, called him nephew), and was welcomed into the home - but 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.' His true purpose was to use Aladdin to get the lamp, and he trapped Aladdin when convenient. These key details convey the message that people who seem generous may hide selfish purposes. The story teaches caution, not complete rejection of strangers.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the magician came from North Africa, the story's message is not about foreign people being dangerous. The problem is his deception and hidden purpose, not his origin. Many folktales come from diverse cultures and teach universal lessons about human behavior, not about distrusting people from other places. Focus on the deception theme, not geography.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This is too extreme and not the story's message. Aladdin's mother 'welcomed the man into their home' when he made promises to help, which was not portrayed as automatically wrong.

The stranger showed apparent kindness (hugs, promises, calling Aladdin 'nephew'), but 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' - he was using them.

At the beginning, the magician's words seemed caring and generous: he called Aladdin 'My dear nephew,' promised to help him 'become a merchant and earn good money,' and said the treasure would make him 'richer than any king.' However, at the end, when facing the pressure of not getting the lamp immediately, his actions revealed the truth - 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp' and he trapped Aladdin without hesitation. The contrast between his early words and his final actions when under pressure teaches that people's true nature is revealed by what they do when challenged, not by what they say when trying to gain cooperation.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story teaches the opposite! The magician falsely claimed to be family ('My dear nephew!'), but 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.' His betrayal at the end shows that family claims mean nothing if actions don't support them. The central lesson is about judging people by their actions under pressure, and the false family claim was part of his deception. The story warns against automatic trust based on claimed relationships.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story does not compare wealthy and poor people's honesty. The magician seeks treasure (making him a treasure-seeker like Aladdin), and his dishonesty has nothing to do with current wealth.

The magician has magical powers and is completely untrustworthy! The story's central lesson has nothing to do with magic making people reliable.

This requires analyzing authorial technique - understanding why the author chose to include this specific detail at this crucial moment.

This detail helps readers understand that the family claim, the merchant promises, and the wealth offers were all manipulation tactics.

The magician is not portrayed as a collector but as a deceiver who lied about being family and made false promises.

This requires analyzing how the author uses character arc to convey theme.

The magician was never actually kind - that was a deception. The text explicitly states 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' and came only to get the lamp using Aladdin.

The author uses this apparent transformation to teach about recognizing deception, not about anger management.

This requires understanding how the author uses a specific plot event to teach a general truth about human behavior. The magician displayed elaborate kindness (hugging Aladdin, false family claims, generous promises), but 'The magician grew very angry' and immediately trapped Aladdin when he couldn't hand over the lamp right away. The instant disappearance of all apparent kindness - with no hesitation, discussion, or second chances - teaches readers that some people's kindness is purely strategic, existing only while it serves their goals. The author structures this moment to reveal a truth about human nature: when someone's caring behavior vanishes instantly when challenged, it was never genuine. This supports the story's message about recognizing manipulative people.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story is not about decision-making time or careful thinking. The magician's instant abandonment of Aladdin reveals his true selfish nature that existed from the start - the text shows 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp.'

The magician's behavior has nothing to do with cultural misunderstanding between North Africa and Persia. His deception, false promises, and betrayal are deliberate character traits, not communication problems.

This requires synthesizing all the magician's actions across the entire story to identify the central warning. The magician made elaborate promises when things were easy (promising wealth, pretending to be family, offering to help), but when he faced a problem (not getting the lamp immediately), his true nature emerged - 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp' and he instantly trapped Aladdin. The complete pattern - generous promises during smooth times contrasted with selfish betrayal when facing obstacles - teaches the most important lesson: true character is revealed under pressure, not in easy circumstances. This is the story's key warning about trust: evaluate people based on their behavior when challenged, not their words when trying to gain your cooperation.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This is too extreme and not the story's message. The problem is not that people offer help, but that this particular person's offer was false - 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.' The story teaches discernment (judging people by their actions under pressure), not complete rejection of all help. Many folktales include genuine helpers. The lesson is about recognizing false promises, not avoiding all assistance.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While verifying identity might have helped, this is not the story's most important warning. Even if they had verified he wasn't really an uncle, his generous promises might still have been tempting. The deeper lesson is about recognizing deceptive character: his instant abandonment when challenged reveals his true nature. The story teaches to judge people by their behavior under pressure, not just to verify identities.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This misses the story's point. Long familiarity doesn't guarantee trustworthiness, and the story's lesson is not about length of relationship. The magician's instant betrayal when facing an obstacle teaches readers to evaluate character based on behavior under pressure, not relationship duration.

The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.\"What do you wish for?\" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, \"Take me out of this cave!\" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.\n\n---\n\n\"This lamp is so dirty,\" said Aladdin's mother. \"Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food.\" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.\"What is your wish?\" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, \"We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!\" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.\n\n---\n\nOne day, Aladdin told his mother, \"I want to marry the Sultan's daughter.\" His mother laughed. \"Have you lost your mind?\" she said. \"Your father was just a poor tailor!\" But Aladdin said, \"Remember those shiny gems from the cave? Take them as a gift to the Sultan.\"Aladdin's mother went to see the Sultan. \"My lord,\" she said, \"my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter.\" The Sultan laughed loudly. \"Your son and my daughter? That's silly!\" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.\"These are amazing!\" the Sultan thought. \"I have never seen such beautiful gems!\" Then the Sultan said, \"Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.\"\n\n---\n\nWhen Aladdin heard this, he rubbed his magic lamp. The genie appeared right away. Aladdin told the genie what the Sultan wanted. Almost instantly, the genie brought forty servants. Each servant carried a large golden bowl. Half the bowls were filled with pearls and diamonds. The other bowls were filled with rubies and emeralds.The Sultan was amazed by all the treasure. He agreed that Aladdin could marry his daughter. Aladdin was so happy! He rubbed the lamp again. The genie appeared and prepared a wedding fit for a prince. The servants brought Aladdin fine clothes and sweet perfumes. They gave him a beautiful horse to ride. They even built him a palace right next to the Sultan's palace. They rolled out a thick red carpet from the Sultan's home to Aladdin's new palace. When the Sultan saw the magnificent palace, he knew Aladdin was perfect for his daughter. They celebrated with a wonderful feast, music, and dancing that lasted all day and all night.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: How does Aladdin most likely feel when he sees the forty servants with bowls of gems?\n- A) happy\n- B) angry\n- C) worried\n- D) scared\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty hard, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

He thought everything was perfect. But danger was coming. The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck.\"That lazy boy?\" the magician said. \"He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!\"The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, \"New lamps for old lamps!\"Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.\"I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,\" she thought.\n\n---\n\nThe princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.\"Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,\" the magician commanded. \"Move it to my home in North Africa.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.\"Find my daughter right now!\" the Sultan shouted. \"If you cannot bring her back, you will die!\"\n\n---\n\nPoor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.\"What do you wish?\" asked the genie of the ring.\"Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,\" Aladdin begged.\"I am sorry,\" said the genie. \"I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.\"\"Then please take me to be with my wife,\" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace. Aladdin and his wife made a plan to get the lamp back.\n\n---\n\nThe next day, the princess cooked a wonderful dinner for the magician. Aladdin hid so the magician could not see him. The princess put poison in the magician's cup. When the magician drank from the cup, he fell down and died.Aladdin ran into the room and looked for the lamp. He found it hidden in the magician's sleeve. Aladdin rubbed the lamp, and the huge genie appeared.\"What do you wish?\" the genie of the lamp asked in a loud voice.\"Take this palace with everything inside it,\" Aladdin commanded. \"Carry it back to Persia and put it next to the Sultan's home.\"\"I hear and I obey,\" the genie replied. The palace lifted up into the air and flew away.The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again! He ordered celebrations for a whole month. From that day on, Aladdin lived peacefully and safely with the princess. When the old Sultan died, Aladdin became the new ruler. He was fair and kind to all people, both rich and poor.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: Read the sentence.\"The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window.

Each variant should focus on a DIFFERENT paragraph, sentence, or detail\n2. **Use DIFFERENT question stems** - Vary between \"What...\", \"Why...\", \"How...\", \"Which detail...\", \"Based on...\", \"According to...\"\n3. **Target DIFFERENT correct answers** - Aim for different answer letters (A, B, C, D) across variants\n4. **Focus on DIFFERENT aspects** - If reference asks about character words, ask about actions, settings, or events\n5. **Require DIFFERENT reasoning** - Each variant should need unique thinking to answer\n\n### What You Must NOT Do (AUTOMATIC REJECTION):\n❌ Do NOT ask about the same phrase, sentence, or paragraph as the reference\n❌ Do NOT rephrase the reference question with minor word changes\n❌ Do NOT create variants where the same reasoning answers multiple questions\n❌ Do NOT have multiple variants about the same concept (e.g., all about \"being rich\")\n❌ Do NOT copy question structure - be creative with how you ask\n\n### BAD Examples (TOO SIMILAR - would be rejected):\n- Reference: \"What does 'richer than any king' mean?\"\n- BAD Variant 1: \"What does 'make any person very rich' mean?\" ← Same concept (wealth)!\n- BAD Variant 2: \"What does 'richer than any king in the world' mean?\" ← Same phrase!\n\n### GOOD Examples (TRULY DIFFERENT):\n- Reference: \"What does 'richer than any king' mean?\"\n- GOOD Variant 1: \"What does the phrase 'the earth split open' describe?\" ← Different text, different concept\n- GOOD Variant 2: \"According to paragraph 1, what job did Aladdin's father have?\" ← Different section, factual recall\n- GOOD Variant 3: \"How does the author show that the location is remote?\" ← Different literary focus\n- GOOD Variant 4: \"What does it mean when the text says the magician 'needed someone to help him'?\" ← Different quote\n\n## Task:\nGenerate 4 DIVERSE variants for EACH reference question.\n- Total questions to generate: 16\n- Each variant must assess the SAME standard at the SAME DOK level\n- Each variant must be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the reference AND from other variants\n\n## Quality Requirements:\n\n### Question Quality:\n1. **Text Dependency**: Must require reading the passage\n2. **Clear and Precise**: One correct answer, no ambiguity\n3. **Grade Appropriate**: Suitable vocabulary for grade 3\n4. **Standard Alignment**: Directly assess the target CCSS\n\n### Answer Choice Quality:\n5. **Plausible Distractors**: Believable but clearly incorrect\n6. **Grammatical Parallelism**: All choices same structure\n7. **Homogeneity**: All choices from same category\n8. **Length Balance**: Within 10% word count\n9. **Semantic Distance**: No synonyms or too-close pairs\n\n### Feedback Requirements:\nFor CORRECT: Why correct + text evidence + strategy\nFor INCORRECT: Why wrong + misconception + guidance\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate exactly 16 questions in the variant_questions array.\nFirst all 4 variants for Reference 1, then all for Reference 2, etc.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"variant_questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"The question text\",\n      \"option_1\": \"Choice A\",\n      \"option_2\": \"Choice B\", \n      \"option_3\": \"Choice C\",\n      \"option_4\": \"Choice D\",\n      \"correct_answer\": \"A\",\n      \"option_1_explanation\": \"Feedback for A\",\n      \"option_2_explanation\": \"Feedback for B\",\n      \"option_3_explanation\": \"Feedback for C\",\n      \"option_4_explanation\": \"Feedback for D\",\n      \"differentiation_notes\": \"Targets [paragraph X] about [topic Y] -
