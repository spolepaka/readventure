        Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you couldn't hear sounds? Or what if you couldn't see the world around you? Millions of people live with these challenges every day. Some people are deaf, which means they cannot hear well or at all. Other people are blind, which means they cannot see.
People who are deaf have found special ways to talk with others. Many deaf people use American Sign Language. This is a way to communicate using hand movements instead of speaking. Each gesture or hand movement stands for a word or letter. When one person makes these signs, another person can watch and understand the message.
Did you know there is a sign for every letter in the alphabet? You can spell your whole name using these hand signs! Some deaf people also learn to read lips. They watch how a person's mouth moves when they talk. Different sounds make your lips move in different ways. Try talking in a mirror and watch how your lips change shape!

---

Now think about what life would be like if you could not see. How would you walk around your house? How would you know where things are? People who are blind have learned amazing ways to live with their disability. They are overcoming this challenge in many clever ways.
Many blind people use a white cane to help them move around safely. They tap the cane in front of them to feel for walls, steps, and other objects. Some blind people have a special helper called a guide dog. These dogs are trained to help their owners walk safely from place to place. The dogs can stop at curbs and avoid dangerous areas.

---

Blind people also use their other senses more than people who can see. They might recognize you by the sound of your voice or your footsteps. They can tell what food they are eating by how it smells and tastes.
Blind people can also learn to read using a special system called Braille. In Braille, small raised bumps on paper stand for different letters. A blind person runs their fingers over these bumps and feels the patterns. Each pattern of bumps means a different letter. Then they put the letters together to make words, just like you do when you read!

        Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you couldn't hear sounds? Or what if you couldn't see the world around you? Millions of people live with these challenges every day. Some people are deaf, which means they cannot hear well or at all. Other people are blind, which means they cannot see.
People who are deaf have found special ways to talk with others. Many deaf people use American Sign Language. This is a way to communicate using hand movements instead of speaking. Each gesture or hand movement stands for a word or letter. When one person makes these signs, another person can watch and understand the message.
Did you know there is a sign for every letter in the alphabet? You can spell your whole name using these hand signs! Some deaf people also learn to read lips. They watch how a person's mouth moves when they talk. Different sounds make your lips move in different ways. Try talking in a mirror and watch how your lips change shape!

Now think about what life would be like if you could not see. How would you walk around your house? How would you know where things are? People who are blind have learned amazing ways to live with their disability. They are overcoming this challenge in many clever ways.
Many blind people use a white cane to help them move around safely. They tap the cane in front of them to feel for walls, steps, and other objects. Some blind people have a special helper called a guide dog. These dogs are trained to help their owners walk safely from place to place. The dogs can stop at curbs and avoid dangerous areas.

Blind people also use their other senses more than people who can see. They might recognize you by the sound of your voice or your footsteps. They can tell what food they are eating by how it smells and tastes.
Blind people can also learn to read using a special system called Braille. In Braille, small raised bumps on paper stand for different letters. A blind person runs their fingers over these bumps and feels the patterns. Each pattern of bumps means a different letter. Then they put the letters together to make words, just like you do when you read!
