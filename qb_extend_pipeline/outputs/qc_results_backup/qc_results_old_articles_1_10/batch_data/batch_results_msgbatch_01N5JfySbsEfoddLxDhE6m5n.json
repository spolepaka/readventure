        "score": 1,
        "response": "All four answer choices follow the same grammatical structure: each begins with 'To' followed by an infinitive verb phrase that describes the magician's plan. The parallel structure is: 'To [verb] Aladdin [additional details].' This consistent pattern makes the choices grammatically parallel.",

        "score": 1,
        "response": "All incorrect choices (B, C, D) are plausible distractors. Choice B (adopt Aladdin and share powers) is believable because the magician did pretend to be family. Choice C (help Aladdin's family) is plausible because he promised to help Aladdin become a merchant. Choice D (teach merchant trade) is believable because that's what he explicitly claimed he would do. None are obviously wrong without careful analysis of the evidence throughout the story.",

        "score": 1,

Each describes the magician's plan with comparable complexity: what he intended to do with Aladdin and what the end goal was. The choices are balanced in length and descriptive detail, with no choice being noticeably more vague or overly detailed than the others.",

        "response": "This question properly assesses RL.3.2, which addresses recounting stories and determining the central message, lesson, or moral. The question asks students to analyze evidence throughout the story to determine the magician's true plan/motivation, which requires understanding the central conflict and deception in the narrative. This aligns with determining key details and the central elements of the story.",

        "response": "The question is clearly written and unambiguous. The phrase 'Based on evidence throughout the story' clearly indicates students should consider the entire passage. 'What was the magician's plan from the very beginning?' is a precise question with a single interpretation - it asks about the magician's true original intention, not what he claimed.",

        "score": 1,

He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp... To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him.' The passage also shows his deception and ultimate betrayal when he traps Aladdin. No other answer is supported by the evidence.",
