The passage states that astronomers noticed all distant galaxies seem to be moving outward, and this discovery by Hubble led scientists to develop explanations like the Big Bang Theory.", "option_B_explanation": "This is incorrect. While telescopes helped astronomers make observations, the passage doesn't indicate that more powerful telescopes were the evidence that led to the Big Bang Theory.", "option_C_explanation": "This is incorrect. Matter cooling down is described as something that happened after the Big Bang, not evidence that led to developing the theory.", "option_D_explanation": "This is incorrect. Stars forming into round shapes is described as something that happened after the Big Bang when matter cooled, not evidence that led to the theory's development.", "fix_reasoning": "This question addresses all failure issues: grammatical_parallel (all options follow 'noun + verb phrase' structure), plausibility (all options reference actual events from the passage in logical contexts), homogeneity (all options deal with scientific observations/evidence), and length_check (correct answer is only 5 words). The question tests RI.3.7 by asking students to identify specific evidence from the text that supported scientific reasoning.", "fix_strategy": "full_regeneration", "question_id": "quiz_302727_sibling_1", "original_question": "According to the passage, what comparison does the author use to help readers understand how small the universe was before the Big Bang?"}}

The speaker doesn't mention leaving Ohio or express sadness about it.", "option_B_explanation": "Correct. The speaker shows pride by connecting her birthplace to freedom and describing how 'brown children like me can grow up free' there.", "option_C_explanation": "Incorrect. The speaker clearly understands her birthplace and its meaning in her family's story.", "option_D_explanation": "Incorrect. The speaker describes Ohio as a place of freedom and opportunity, not something to worry about.", "fix_reasoning": "This question properly addresses RL.4.6 by asking students to identify the speaker's feelings/perspective about her birthplace. It uses grade-appropriate vocabulary, has plausible distractors of similar length, and focuses on emotions that third graders can understand. The correct answer is clearly supported by the text's positive description of freedom and opportunities.", "fix_strategy": "full_regeneration", "question_id": "quiz_303004_sibling_3", "original_question": "Why does the author choose to tell about her birth and her family's history in the same poem?"}}
