The passage clearly states the sequence: Aladdin yelled, then cried, then prayed by putting his hands together, and 'When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger.' This action of praying directly led to rubbing the ring, which caused the genie to appear. The other options describe actions that occurred but did not lead to the stated outcomes: yelling didn't bring back the magician, crying didn't break the walls, and calling out didn't bring the genie.",
