        Hello, Rattenborough here again! Scientists who study animals put them into different groups. They look at many things about animals. Some scientists check if animals have hair or scales on their skin. They see if animals have live babies or lay eggs. They also check if mothers feed milk to their babies. Scientists want to know if animals are warm-blooded or cold-blooded too.
One very important thing scientists study is the animal's backbone. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Humans are vertebrates too! Put your hand on the back of your neck. Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.

---

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

---

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.

Do you feel a bump? Now rub your hand up and down the middle of your back. You can feel bumpy bones that go in a row down your back. These bones go from your neck to your waist. This is your backbone. Another name for backbone is spine.

Your backbone or spine does an important job. It wraps around and keeps safe a special part of your body called the spinal cord. The spinal cord is like a bundle of nerves. Messages travel up and down your spinal cord from your brain to other parts of your body. This is how your brain tells the rest of your body what to do.
Many other animals are vertebrates too. All mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds have a backbone. This means they are all vertebrates. They have some type of spinal cord as well. Animals with a backbone come in many different shapes and sizes. Apes, rhinos, horses, rabbits, and bats are all mammals and vertebrates. Lizards, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles are reptiles and vertebrates. Big sharks and tiny goldfish are also vertebrates. Small hummingbirds and large eagles are vertebrates too.

But many animals do not have a backbone at all. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates. Insects are the biggest group in the animal kingdom. Insects are also the biggest group of invertebrates. Insects include flies, wasps, beetles, cockroaches, ladybugs, and butterflies. Other kinds of invertebrates include earthworms and spiders.

article_101012,Classifying Living Things,test_quiz,5,quiz_302096_sibling_1,quiz,,"Classifying Living Things
    
    
        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

---

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

---

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom.

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

---

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

---

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

---

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!

While section 4 mentions insects are the most numerous, the passage doesn't suggest scientists are trying to prove their importance. The focus is on discovering unknown species. Reread what the passage says about scientists' future work.","This is incorrect. Section 4 doesn't mention studying animals in specific climates.

This evidence supports the conclusion that scientists continue their work because they believe vast numbers of living things remain undiscovered.","This is incorrect.

We classify things around us so we can know our world better. As we learn about living things, we also learn about ourselves. So far, scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals. Most of these are insects! Many scientists think there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet!
That's all for now! Rattenborough, over and out! I will be back in the next chapter to tell you more about how animals are sorted into different groups.",,,,,How do the sentences about scientists finding 1 million animals and possibly 10 million undiscovered animals work together in section 4?,MCQ,They compare insects to other animals like birds and fish,They contrast what is known with what remains to be learned,They describe the sequence of how scientists classify living things,They explain the cause of why plants stay in one spot,B,"This is incorrect. While section 4 mentions insects, these particular sentences about 1 million found and 10 million undiscovered are not comparing different animal types. They're discussing the scope of scientific knowledge. Look at what these two numbers tell us when placed together.",Correct! These sentences create a contrast: 'scientists have found over 1 million different kinds of animals' (known) versus 'there may be close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet' (unknown). Placing these together emphasizes how much more scientists still have to discover compared to what they already know.,This is incorrect. Classification sequence is discussed earlier in the passage. These sentences in section 4 don't describe steps in a process - they present numbers about discovered versus undiscovered animals. Think about what relationship these two numbers have to each other.,"This is incorrect. Plant movement is discussed in section 3, not section 4. These sentences about animal numbers don't explain anything about plants. They relate to the scope of scientific discovery.

        Hello! Rattenborough here! I am back to help you learn about living things. Do you remember me? I study animals and plants. Today we will learn how scientists sort living things into groups. This sorting is called classifying. Let me ask you something important. How do you know if something is alive or not alive?
All living things have special things about them. These special things are called characteristics. Here are the main characteristics all living things have. All living things make energy from food. All living things can have babies or make more living things like themselves. All living things have a life cycle. This means they start small and then grow big. All living things can adapt. This means they change to fit better in their home.

Plants are one big group of living things. Plants have all the same characteristics as other living things. Plants make energy from food, but they make their own food! They use the sun, water, and air to make food. Plants make seeds that become new plants. Plants grow from tiny seeds into small plants and then become adult plants. Plants can adapt to their habitat. A habitat is the place where something lives. For example, a cactus lives in a dry desert. It does not need as much water as other plants.
Animals are living things too! Animal groups come in all shapes and sizes. Animals get energy from the food they eat. Animals can have babies. Baby animals start small but grow into adult animals. Animals can adapt to their habitat too. Polar bears have white fur so they can hide in the snow where they live.

Plants and animals are both living things, but they are different in important ways. For example, animals move from place to place, but plants stay in one spot. Scientists study how living things are the same and different. Then they sort or classify them into big groups called kingdoms. There are five kingdom groups of living things. You just learned about two of them. These are the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
Scientists study animals in the animal kingdom. They classify them by looking at what makes them the same. One way scientists sort animals is by checking if they have a backbone. Insects do not have backbones, but birds and fish do. So animals with backbones go in different groups. Insects make up the biggest group in the animal kingdom. But there are other big groups like birds and fish too.

That's all for now! Rattenborough, over and out! I will be back in the next chapter to tell you more about how animals are sorted into different groups.",,,,,What does the relationship between sections 3 and 4 suggest about the classification of animals?,MCQ,Classification is complete because scientists have sorted all known animals,Classification is ongoing work as scientists discover more animals to study,Classification only applies to animals that live in cold snowy places,Classification is impossible because there are too many types of insects,B,"This is incorrect. Section 4 directly contradicts this by stating scientists think there may be 10 million undiscovered animals, showing classification is far from complete. The relationship between sections shows classification is active work. Reread the numbers and future predictions in section 4.","Correct! Section 3 explains how scientists currently classify animals (by features like backbones), while section 4 reveals millions of animals remain undiscovered ('close to 10 million other animals that we have not found yet'). Together, these sections show classification is an ongoing process that continues as new species are discovered.","This is incorrect. Section 3 uses various examples (insects, birds, fish) without limiting to cold climates, and section 4 discusses animal discoveries generally, not in specific habitats. The sections together show classification applies broadly. Look at the variety of animals mentioned across both sections.","This is incorrect. While section 4 mentions many insects exist, section 3 shows scientists successfully classify animals including insects using characteristics like backbones. The sections together demonstrate classification works despite large numbers. Think about how section 3 shows classification methods and section 4 shows scope.",3,medium,RI.3.8,3,quiz_302099,2026-01-10T18:52:07.505890,Synthesizes meaning from relationship between two sections (3 and 4) - differs from reference which asks what single section suggests,,all choices are conclusions about the nature/state of classification,all at similar level making claims about classification as a scientific process,"10-14 words each, balanced within 10%","distinct claims (complete, ongoing, location-limited, impossible)",only B is supported by combining information from both sections,requires synthesizing across two sections' relationship rather than drawing inference from one section like reference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
