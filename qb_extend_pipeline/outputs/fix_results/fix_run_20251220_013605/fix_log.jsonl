It fixes homogeneity by ensuring all options are general life lessons about trust and caution. It balances specificity by keeping all options at the same level of generality as practical advice, avoiding overly specific story details while maintaining the thematic focus on trust and deception.", "fix_strategy": "full_regeneration", "question_id": "quiz_302007_sibling_4", "original_question": "Based on the whole story, what message can readers learn about offers that seem too good to be true?"}}
