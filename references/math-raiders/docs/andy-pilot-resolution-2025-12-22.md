# Pilot 1 Resolution Plan

**Date:** December 22, 2025 (updated Jan 6)  
**Status:** Collecting post-tests  
**Next Action:** Send guide emails, monitor TimeBack

---

## TL;DR

Andy wants more data. Get post-tests for remaining students. Present results mid-January. He said "great."

**Update (Jan 7):** Wyatt's post-test came in: 13 CQPM (-1 from Nov 21 baseline of 14). Now at 8 validated, 5/8 improved. Previously: Nova (+7 Jan 6), Everett (-1 Dec 19).

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Dec 9-19 | Pilot 1 runs (18 students) |
| Dec 19 | Pilot analysis sent to Andy |
| Dec 20-21 | Email follow-ups: Andy asks clarifying questions |
| Dec 22 (AM) | Andy email: "When will you publish results with more than half the students?" |
| Dec 22 (PM) | Meeting with Andy — resolved |

## What Andy Asked For

**Email:**
> "When will you publish the results that have more than half the students? It's really hard to draw conclusions from 'cherry-picked' data."

**Meeting:**
1. Get post-tests for the students who missed them
2. Dive into the 2 students it "didn't work for" — explain why, propose fix
3. Come back with full data

## The Data Gap

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Validated (pre/post) | 8 | ✅ Done (5 improved, 3 flat/declined) |
| Pre-test only (pending post) | 6 | ❌ Need post-tests |
| Excluded (contamination, mismatch, no data) | 4 | Skip |

**Current:** 8/18 = 44% validated → **5/8 improved (62%)**  
**Target:** 14/18 = 78% validated

*Note: Nova added (Jan 6, +7), Wyatt added (Jan 7, -1). Everett remains at -1 (Dec 19); his Jan 5 follow-up (+4) is noted but not counted in headline.*

---

## The 6 Who Need Post-Tests

| Student | Track | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Jace Joslyn | Addition | Pending |
| Geraldine Gurrola | Addition | Pending (now in MR, no AMF) |
| Emma Schipper | Addition | Pending |
| Sebastian Holzhauer | Addition | Pending (now in MR, no AMF) |
| Hawk Henson | Subtraction | Pending |
| Landen Goikhman | Subtraction | Pending |

*Nova Victore completed Jan 6 (+7). Wyatt Victore completed Jan 7 (-1).*

## The 3 "Failures" — Root Cause

| Student | Result | Root Cause |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Everett | -1 | High volume but late accuracy focus (week 1: 75% acc → week 2: 89%) |
| Wyatt | -1 | Lowest engagement in cohort (5.3 min/day) |
| Ansel | -2 | Low engagement (7.2 min/day, started late) |

**Everett note:** Dec 19 post-test = 24 (-1 from 25 baseline). A Jan 5 follow-up showed 29 CQPM (+4) after no AMF during break — possible delayed consolidation. Not counted in headline as it's outside the defined post-test window.

**Wyatt note:** Pre Nov 21 (14), Post Jan 7 (13). Lowest engagement at 5.3 min/day. Follows the pattern: low engagement = no gains.

**Key reframe:** No one cratered. All 3 failures have clear root causes: engagement or late accuracy correction. When students engage correctly, it works.

---

## Resolution

Andy said "great" at end of meeting. Path forward is clear:

1. **Get post-tests** — email guides Jan 5
2. **Present full data** — mid-January
3. **Root cause non-improvers** — engagement, not app
4. **Propose path** — session 3 if needed

## Predictions (Unbiased) — Remaining 6

| Student | AMF Peak | MR Peak | Gap | Likely Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|----------------|
| Geraldine | 14 | 24.1 | +10.1 | ✅ Improve |
| Emma | 13 | 18.5 | +5.5 | ✅ Improve |
| Hawk | 5 | 9.6 | +4.6 | ✅ Improve |
| Jace | 16 | 20.5 | +4.5 | ✅ Improve |
| Sebastian | 15 | 16.0 | +1.0 | ➖ Flat |
| Landen | 25 | 20.0 | -5.0 | ❌ Decline (only 1 Sub raid) |

**Already confirmed:** 5/8 improved from validated group (Nova +7 Jan 6, Wyatt -1 Jan 7 as predicted)  
**Expected total:** 9/14 improved (64%) if predictions hold

---

## Scenario Planning

| Scenario | Result | Andy's Response | Next Step |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **WIN** (10+/13) | 77%+ improved | "Let's expand" | Session 3 = growth |
| **MODERATE** (7-9/13) | 54-69% improved | "Keep going" | Session 3 = prove consistency |
| **LOSE** (<7/13) | <54% improved | "What's wrong?" | Diagnose, fix, reset |

---

## Key Learnings

### Framing Matters
- ❌ "5/8 improved, 3 didn't" → sounds mixed
- ✅ "3/8 broke through ceilings they'd been stuck at for months. 5/8 improved overall. The 3 who didn't: all had low engagement or late accuracy focus. When students engage correctly, it works." → sounds like breakthroughs with clear root causes

### Andy's Lens
- He wants to approve — needs cover to do it
- "Cherry-picked" = skepticism, not accusation (note the quotes)
- He applies this rigor to everyone, not just MR
- Objections are buying signals, not rejection

### Meeting Takeaways
- Don't raise problems before Andy does (pre-emptive defense looks weak)
- State a plan, don't offer alternatives ("I'll do X" not "should I do X or Y?")
- Redirect wrong framings instead of absorbing them
- 2-week break doesn't invalidate data — Andy said so himself

## The Email to Guides

Send **Jan 5** (Monday 7am, schedule send):

**Subject:** Quick ask: AlphaMath Fluency test for [Student], [Student]

> Hi [Name],
>
> Could you have these students do a 2-min AlphaMath Fluency speed test? Last step to see if Math Raiders helped.
>
> - **[Student]** — Addition  
> - **[Student]** — Addition
>
> Thanks!
>
> — Campbell

**Why this version:**
- Subject line with student names → personal, higher open rate
- "2-min" → low effort signal
- "Last step" → closure, bounded task
- "if Math Raiders helped" → student-focused, not "for my pilot data"
- No redundancy → subject does "quick ask", body delivers

## Mid-January Playbook

### Phase 1: Collect (Jan 5-10)
- Post-tests come in (7 students take AMF on assigned tracks)
- Monitor TimeBack for scores as they appear
- Nudge if needed — if guide hasn't done it by Jan 8, gentle reminder

### Phase 2: Analyze (Jan 10-12)
- Run `analyze_pilot.py` with fresh backup
- Build the table: 13 validated, who improved, who didn't
- Calculate headline: "X/13 improved (Y%)"
- Root cause every non-improver

### Phase 3: Frame the Story (Jan 12-13)

**If WIN (10+/13, 77%+):**
> "13 validated students. 10 improved. 4 broke through ceilings they'd been stuck at for months. The ones who didn't improve: clear root causes (engagement, accuracy focus). When students engage correctly, it works."

**If MODERATE (7-9/13, 54-69%):**
> "13 validated students. 8 improved. No one cratered. Failures have clear root causes — engagement or late accuracy correction. Signal is there. Next step: session 3 with tighter engagement accountability."

**If LOSE (<7/13, <54%):**
> "Results are mixed. The 2-week break may have contributed to decay, or there's something else going on. Here's what I see in the data: [honest analysis]. Proposed next step: controlled session 3 with no break in the middle."

### Phase 4: Present to Andy (Jan 13-15)
Short email or doc (not a meeting unless he asks):
1. **Headline:** "X/13 improved (Y%)"
2. **Breakthroughs:** Name the stars (Octavia, etc.)
3. **Failures explained:** Each with root cause
4. **No disasters:** "No one cratered. Worst case was -2."
5. **Proposed next step:** Session 3 expansion / tighter pilot / whatever fits

### Phase 5: Handle Andy's Questions (Jan 15-17)

| Likely question | Your answer |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "What about the ones who didn't improve?" | Root cause: engagement (low usage = low gains) |
| "Why should I believe this at scale?" | "Engagement predicts improvement. When students use it, it works." |
| "What's next?" | "Session 3 with [X fix]" — depends on results |
| "How do you fix engagement?" | "Guides have visibility via TimeBack. Enforcement is on Alpha's side. I can add alerts." |

### Phase 6: Get Session 3 Approved (Jan 17+)
> "I'd like to run session 3 with tighter logistics: upfront guide commitment, no break in middle, targeted track assignment. Can Gui help recruit guides?"
