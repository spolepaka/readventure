For sixty years, keeper Thomas Marsh had climbed the spiral staircase each evening to light the lamp. His hands, weathered and strong, knew every step by heart.\n\nOne stormy November night, the lighthouse lamp flickered and nearly died. Thomas worked frantically, his arthritic fingers fumbling with the machinery. Below, he knew, ships were counting on that light. 'Not on my watch,' he muttered, and with one final effort, the light blazed back to life.\n\nThe next morning, the harbor master came with news: a cargo ship had made it safely to port, guided by the lighthouse beam during the worst of the storm. Thomas smiled quietly and began his climb up the stairs once more.",
