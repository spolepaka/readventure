Next time, reread the sentence that tells how the character feels and choose the word that matches it exactly.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600105\">\n        angry\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600105\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have guessed she was angry because a stranger came, but the story doesn’t say that. It says, “She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother,” so the correct answer is surprised, not angry. Next time, reread the sentence with feeling words and pick the word that matches what the text says.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600107\">\n        excited\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600107\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the promise of good money and her welcoming him, which can sound exciting, but the text says, “She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother,” so the correct answer is surprised. To find the right answer, look for the exact sentence that tells how the character feels and match your choice to that word.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600108\">\n        surprised\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600108\" show-hide=\"show\">Great job identifying a key detail about the character’s feelings.

Next time, reread the sentence where the event happens and pick the detail that explains it.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600110\">\n        words make the earth split open\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600110\" show-hide=\"show\">You successfully recognized cause and effect by connecting the magician’s words to what happened next. The text supports this: “he… spoke magical words in a loud voice.

Suddenly… The earth split open right at their feet,” showing the words caused it—not Aladdin gathering sticks. The correct answer is “words make the earth split open.” Strategy: Reread the lines around the big event and pick the cause the text points to, not an earlier step.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

Look at “He only cared about getting the magic lamp… he spoke a magic spell… Poor Aladdin was trapped”—the magician’s greed causes trouble. So the best answer is that the story teaches that greed can lead to trouble; next time, ask, What lesson do the characters learn from what happens?</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600116\">\n        interest readers in collecting gems\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600116\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the shiny gems and thought the author wants to interest readers in collecting them, but the text shows the opposite: “all those gems made his bag very heavy” so Aladdin couldn’t climb out, and the magician “only cared about getting the magic lamp” and trapped him. These details teach that greed leads to trouble, which is the main message. Next time, ask yourself, “Do the events show a benefit or a warning?” and choose the answer that matches the lesson of the whole passage.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600113\">\n        teach readers that greed can lead to trouble\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600113\" show-hide=\"show\">Great job—you found the story’s lesson (theme) by noticing how greed leads to problems. The text shows this when “Aladdin…filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy…he could not pull himself out,” and when the magician “only cared about getting the magic lamp” and trapped Aladdin. Next time, look for warnings and then see what trouble follows a character’s choice to want too much to spot the theme.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600115\">\n        make readers feel sorry for the magician\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600115\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the magician’s feelings instead of the main idea, but the text says \"The magician grew very angry... He only cared about getting the magic lamp\" and even says \"Poor Aladdin,\" so we are not meant to feel sorry for the magician. The story’s lesson is that greed causes trouble: the magician’s greed makes him trap Aladdin, and Aladdin’s heavy bag of gems keeps him stuck. Next time, ask, \"What lesson do the events show?\" and look for clue words that cover the whole passage, not just one character’s feelings.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

So the correct answer is that Aladdin will have more money than he can count.

Next time, stick to the exact words and look for clue phrases about the main idea, like “very rich.”</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600120\">\n        Aladdin will meet kings from other countries\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600120\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the word “king” and guessed he’d meet kings, but the text never says Aladdin will meet any kings; it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the treasure “will make you richer than any king in the world.” That evidence points to the correct answer: Aladdin will have more money than he can count.

The text supports this when the magician says, “First, hand me the lamp,” and Aladdin replies, “I cannot reach it right now.” Remember to reread what happens right before and after an event to see why it happens.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600121\">\n        Aladdin won't to go into the cave.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600121\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have thought Aladdin refused to go into the cave, but the story says he “agreed to help” and “went down into the dark cave below.” The problem is that “the lamp was buried deep in Aladdin’s heavy bag,” so he couldn’t reach it and didn’t give it to the magician right away—that’s why the correct answer is “Aladdin doesn’t give him the lamp right away.” Next time, reread and find the exact sentence in the text that answers the question.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600123\">\n        Aladdin takes too many gems from the cave.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600123\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the gems, but the text shows the problem happens when Aladdin won’t give the lamp right away: “First, hand me the lamp… The magician grew very angry,” and then he seals the cave. So the correct answer is that Aladdin doesn’t hand over the lamp right away. Next time, reread the sentences just before the trouble to find the real cause.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600124\">\n        Aladdin breaks the magic ring on his finger.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600124\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have brought in an idea that isn’t in this part of the story (the ring breaking), but look at the text: “First, hand me the lamp…,” “I cannot reach it right now,” and “The magician grew very angry,” which shows he’s mad because Aladdin doesn’t give him the lamp right away. The passage never says the ring breaks; it only says the ring will keep him safe. To find the right answer, reread the lines around the event and look for cause-and-effect clue words (like “first,” “when”), and choose the option that matches what the text directly says.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The text supports this when the man promises to help Aladdin “learn to become a merchant and earn good money” and says the treasure will make him “richer than any king in the world,” but then he traps Aladdin in the cave. Remember, when finding a story’s lesson, ask yourself, “What happens after a character makes a big promise?”</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600127\">\n        Hard work is the only way to become wealthy and successful.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600127\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the detail that Aladdin’s mother works hard, but the story’s events point to a different lesson. Aladdin doesn’t become rich through hard work—the stranger pretends to be his uncle, promises to make him a merchant, then uses magic and traps Aladdin in the cave to get the lamp. This shows the real lesson: be careful about trusting strangers who make big promises.

The man promises Aladdin he will “earn good money” and find a treasure “richer than any king,” then he tricks Aladdin and traps him, so the lesson is to be careful about trusting strangers who make big promises.

The correct answer is that he wanted Aladdin to bring him the magic lamp.

Next time, reread to find the sentence that tells a character’s real reason, not just their first actions or words.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600131\">\n        To get Aladdin to bring him the magic lamp.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600131\" show-hide=\"show\">You successfully identified a character’s motive by noticing the magician pretended to be Aladdin’s uncle so Aladdin would bring him the lamp. The text supports this when it says he came “to search for a special magic lamp… [and] needed someone to help him,” and later he demands, “First, hand me the lamp.” Remember to ask yourself, “What does the character want?” and look for lines that state goals or demands when answering similar questions.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600132\">\n        So he can take Aladdin for a long mountain walk.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600132\" show-hide=\"show\">It looks like you focused on the long walk up the mountain, but the text says the magician came “to search for a special magic lamp,” told Aladdin “Bring that lamp back to me,” and “only cared about getting the magic lamp,” so his goal wasn’t the walk. The correct answer is that he took Aladdin to get him to bring the magic lamp. Next time, look for what the character wants most (the main goal) and make sure your answer matches that, not just one event.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The text shows this when “the magician… fell down and died,” and then “Aladdin lived peacefully and safely… and was fair and kind to all people.” Remember to look at how the problem is solved and what happens to the good and bad characters at the end to figure out the message in similar stories.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600180\">\n        interest readers in learning about palaces.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600180\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the palace detail, but notice how the princess and Aladdin stop the evil magician (“the magician…fell down and died”), get the lamp back, and then live safely while Aladdin rules kindly. These events show that good wins over evil, which is the correct answer. Next time, make sure your choice matches the lesson of the whole story, not just one interesting detail.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600179\">\n        make readers feel sorry for the magician.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600179\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the magician’s death and thought the story wants you to feel sorry for him, but the text shows he hid the lamp “in the magician’s sleeve,” and Aladdin and the princess stop him. After the genie returns the palace, there are “celebrations for a whole month,” and Aladdin becomes a fair, kind ruler—this shows the big idea is that good wins over evil.

The bigger idea is that the heroes stop the evil magician, the Sultan celebrates “for a whole month,” and Aladdin becomes “fair and kind,” showing that good wins over evil.

That’s why the correct answer is a large building where important people live.

His daughter’s palace was completely gone! So was the princess,” which shows the palace is where she lives, not a shop. The correct answer is “a large building where important people live.” Next time, reread the sentences around the word and check that your meaning fits the whole scene, not just one detail.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600184\">\n        a building where soldiers stay and train\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600184\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have mixed up “palace” with a place for soldiers, but the text says “Aladdin’s palace,” “his daughter’s palace,” and that it was put next to the Sultan’s home—the princess and Aladdin live there, not soldiers. This shows palace means a large building where important people live.

The text shows this when it says, “The princess gave Aladdin’s magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic,” after he called, “New lamps for old lamps!” Remember to look for the who, what, and how in the same part of the passage and underline those clues to confirm your answer.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600185\">\n        Goodwill by generously replacing worn-out lamps with new ones.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600185\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have thought he was being kind by replacing old lamps, but the story says he was the evil magician in disguise who shouted “New lamps for old lamps!” and then “hurried away with the real lamp,” which shows a trick, not kindness. So the correct answer is that he got Aladdin’s genie lamp by tricking the princess. Next time, reread what the character does after an offer to see if it is helpful or a trick.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600187\">\n        Permission to work in the palace by offering free replacements.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600187\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have thought he was hired to work at the palace, but the story says he “walked by Aladdin’s palace and shouted, ‘New lamps for old lamps!’” and “The princess gave Aladdin’s magic lamp to the magician,” so he tricked her into giving him the lamp, not a job. The correct answer is that he got Aladdin’s genie lamp by tricking the princess. Next time, reread the lines about the trade and ask, “What did each person give or get?” to be sure your answer matches the text.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600188\">\n        Any old lamp that looks valuable so he can resell it for profit.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600188\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the cry “New lamps for old lamps!” and thought he wanted any valuable lamp to sell, but the story says, “This must be magic from the lamp!” and shows he dressed up to trick the princess into giving him Aladdin’s special lamp, which he then rubbed to use the genie. So the correct answer is that he wanted Aladdin’s genie lamp by tricking the princess. Strategy: Reread for lines that state a character’s goal, not just what they pretend to do.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

But the text shows the problem starts when the princess trades the “old, ugly lamp,” the magician uses it to steal the palace, and even the ring genie says he cannot move it—so believing isn’t enough. The lesson is to be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its worth.

Look at when the princess trades the “old, ugly” lamp for a shiny one and then the palace disappears; this shows the lesson: be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its worth. Next time, focus on the main mistake and its consequence to find the story’s lesson.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600190\">\n        Be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its true worth\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600190\" show-hide=\"show\">You successfully found the story’s lesson by noticing that the princess gave away something valuable without knowing its worth. The text supports this when it says, “The princess gave Aladdin’s magic lamp to the magician,” and afterward the palace was “completely gone.” Remember, to find the lesson in stories, look at a character’s choice and what happens because of it.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600189\">\n        Always trust strangers who offer to trade with you because you might get unexpected rewards\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600189\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have thought the trade led to a good surprise, but the text says, “The princess gave Aladdin’s magic lamp to the magician… [he] moved the palace,” which shows trusting the stranger caused big trouble, not rewards. The lesson is to be careful not to give away something valuable without knowing its worth—the princess didn’t know the “old, ugly” lamp was magic and lost everything. Next time, check what happens after a choice in the story (the result) and choose the answer that matches that main outcome.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The text shows, “The princess gave Aladdin’s magic lamp to the magician… Later that day, he rubbed the lamp… ‘Take Aladdin’s palace…’,” so the palace was taken because the lamp was magic and the magician used it.

Look at “The princess gave Aladdin’s magic lamp to the magician… Later that day, he rubbed the lamp… ‘Take Aladdin’s palace…’” which shows the magician used the magic lamp and genie to move the palace away. The correct answer is that the old lamp was magic and he used it to take their palace; next time, reread the lines that explain why the problem happened and pick the answer that matches the text.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

These clues show she was bored and sleepy, not eager to work, so the correct answer is bored with sitting by the river. Next time, reread for feeling words and make sure your choice matches how the character feels in the whole passage.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600198\">\n        excited about her sister's book\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600198\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the mention of her sister’s book and assumed Alice was excited, but the text says she was “very tired” and the book had “no pictures” or “talking,” and she even thinks, “What good is a book without pictures or talking?” These clues show she isn’t excited—she’s bored with sitting by the river, which is the correct answer. Next time, look for feeling words and clue phrases like “tired” and “nothing fun to do” to make sure your choice matches what the story actually says.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600197\">\n        bored with sitting by the river\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600197\" show-hide=\"show\">Great job identifying key details about the character’s feelings by recognizing that Alice was bored with sitting by the river. The text supports this: 'Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do.' Remember to look for feeling words and clues in the first sentences to figure out how a character feels in a passage.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600200\">\n        worried about the White Rabbit\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600200\" show-hide=\"show\">It looks like you focused on the surprising White Rabbit at the end, but the text says, “Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river” and “There was nothing fun to do,” which shows she was bored—not worried. To find the right answer, notice what the passage talks about the most at the beginning and choose “bored with sitting by the river.” Next time, check that your answer matches what the whole passage is about, not just one exciting detail.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The correct answer is that she goes from standing on the ground to falling down a deep well.

The correct choice is “The girl fell off her bike and hurt her knee,” because it uses “hurt” as a physical injury like in the passage.

Remember to reread the sentence and try a simple synonym that fits the action when you see a tricky word.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

He says, “One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter,” and Alice eats pieces until she is back to normal. So the correct answer is that he helps her control her size, not find her way home.

The other side will make you grow shorter,” and Alice eats until she is back to her normal size. This shows the main point is she learned to control her size, not to meet new friends. Next time, ask yourself, “What changes for the character after this part?” to find the real reason.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600244\">\n        smoke a pipe\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600244\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the detail that the Caterpillar was smoking a pipe, but notice the lines, “One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller… The other side will make you grow shorter,” and “She… was back to her normal size,” which show he helped Alice control her size. The correct answer is control her size because his advice let her change how tall she was. Next time, reread the question and pick the answer that matches what the character learned or could do, not just an interesting detail.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600241\">\n        control her size\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600241\" show-hide=\"show\">You successfully identified key details by noticing how Alice uses the mushroom to manage her height. The text supports this when it says, “One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter,” and “She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.” Remember to look for cause-and-effect clues—what a character is told and what they do next—to figure out what they can do or learn.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” the anger belongs to the Duchess, not the Rabbit. The Rabbit says “Oh no!,” gets scared, drops his gloves and fan, and runs away—these are signs he is worried, so “worriedly” is correct.

The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!”, so he isn’t silent. Those words show he feels nervous, so “worriedly” is the correct answer. Next time, reread the exact lines about the character and use clue words in the dialogue (like “Oh no!”) to match the feeling.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600246\">\n        bravely\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600246\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the Rabbit moving quickly and thought that meant he was acting bravely, but look at “Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” and “he got scared and ran away,” which show he is worried, not brave. The correct answer is worriedly because his words and actions show worry. Next time, reread the sentences around the clue and pick the word that matches the feelings shown in the text.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The correct idea is that each section adds a new size change that makes bigger problems until the Caterpillar explains the mushroom, and Alice uses tiny bites to control her size.

The text shows this: “she was only ten inches tall… had forgotten the little golden key,” then “I am growing bigger and bigger… much too big to fit through the doorway,” and later the Caterpillar says, “One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller,” which helps her get back to normal.

This means each part adds a new size change that causes bigger problems until she learns control—not “bigger, then smaller, then solution” each time.

You successfully identified a pattern and key details by noticing that Alice changes size whenever she eats or drinks. The text shows this when it says, “She was getting smaller and smaller” after the bottle, “Now I am growing bigger and bigger!” after the cake, and the Caterpillar explains, “One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.” Remember to look for repeated events and cause-and-effect clues (like what happens after she eats or drinks) when answering similar questions.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600264\">\n        She keeps losing her shoes.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600264\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the line “I can barely see my feet” and turned it into “losing shoes,” but the story never mentions shoes. Instead, it shows a pattern: she shrinks after drinking from the bottle, grows huge after eating the “EAT ME” cake, and later changes size again by eating mushroom pieces. So the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over after eating or drinking. Next time, reread for exact words and look for events that repeat to find the main idea.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600263\">\n        She keeps getting locked out of her house.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600263\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the door mix-up and thought she was locked out of a house. But the story says she “was getting smaller,” the cake made her “growing bigger and bigger,” later she was “getting smaller again,” and the Caterpillar explains the mushroom can make her taller or shorter. This shows the main thing that keeps happening is her size changing after she eats or drinks, which is why the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over. Tip: look for what happens again and again to find the best answer.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600261\">\n        She keeps turning invisible whenever she talks.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600261\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have thought the line “as she spoke” meant she turned invisible, but the text says she is “getting smaller and smaller” and later “growing bigger and bigger”—it never says she disappears. The correct answer is that Alice keeps shrinking and growing after she eats or drinks (bottle, cake, mushroom). Next time, reread for the exact words that tell what changes (smaller, bigger, grow, shrink) and make sure your answer matches those words.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The correct answer is that she wants to find her way home because the text states it directly.

The text clearly states, “She wanted to find her way home,” and she asks the Cat “which way I should go,” showing her aim is to get home. Next time, look for a sentence that directly tells what the character wants and make sure your answer matches the main idea, not just one detail.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

Next time, reread the part of the text the question is about and pick a quote from that moment—here, “Stuff and nonsense!” is the correct one.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

Notice the ending: “Just at that moment, Alice woke up… she was so excited to tell her sister about her amazing dream,” which shows the passage is about a girl who has a magical dream.

The text supports this when it says, “Just at that moment, Alice woke up! … Alice was so excited to tell her sister about her amazing dream and all her adventures in Wonderland.” Remember to ask yourself, “What is this mostly about?” and check the ending for clues that reveal the main idea.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600324\">\n        to show how to be brave like Alice\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600324\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the brave moment (“I won’t!” Alice replied bravely), but most of the text describes her strange adventures and then says she “woke up” and told her sister about “her amazing dream,” showing it’s mainly about the dream. So the purpose is to tell about a girl who has a magical dream, not to teach how to be brave.

The author’s purpose is to tell a story about a girl’s magical dream in Wonderland, not give instructions.

The text supports this when it says “she entered the garden,” then “The croquet game was very strange,” later “A trial was starting!” and finally “Just at that moment, Alice woke up!” Remember to track what happens first, next, then last by using paragraph breaks and clue words to guide your answer.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600325\">\n        Each section explains the rules of a different game Alice plays with the Queen, building up to the trial.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600325\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the croquet game, but the later parts aren’t about game rules: Alice meets the Mock Turtle and Gryphon and hears about school subjects, then “Suddenly… a trial was starting,” and “Just at that moment, Alice woke up!” The right idea is that each section is a new episode that moves the story from entering the garden to waking up. Strategy: Check that your answer fits all sections, not just one, and use clue words like “Suddenly” and “Just at that moment” to see how the plot moves.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600326\">\n        Each section presents a school lesson taught by a new teacher, ending when Alice meets her sister in class.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600326\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the word “school” and pictured classroom lessons with a new teacher, but the text shows different adventures: Alice plays croquet in the garden, meets the Mock Turtle and Gryphon, goes to a trial, and then wakes up by the river with her sister—not in a class. The right idea is that each part is a new event in Wonderland that moves the story along from entering the garden to waking up. Next time, stick to what the passage says and check how each section adds the next step of the story.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600328\">\n        Each section repeats the same scene with small changes, keeping Alice in one place until she sails away.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600328\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have brought in another part of the story and thought the scenes repeat, but this passage shows new events each time: Alice enters the garden to play croquet, then meets the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon, then runs to a trial, and finally wakes up. So the right answer is that each section adds a new part of the adventure, moving from entering the garden to waking up. Strategy: Reread the first and last lines of each paragraph to see how the place and action change, and use only what this passage says (there is no sailing away here).</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The text supports this: 'Just at that moment, Alice woke up!... excited to tell her sister about her amazing dream and all her adventures in Wonderland.' When answering similar questions, reread the last paragraph to look for clues (like waking up) that explain what was real.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600329\">\n        They were lessons from Alice’s book.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600329\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the silly “school subjects” and thought they were real lessons from a book, but the text says, “Just at that moment, Alice woke up! … her special dream,” showing the adventures were a dream, not book lessons. The correct answer is that they were part of a dream Alice had. Next time, reread the ending for clue words like “woke up” and “dream” and make sure your answer fits the whole passage.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The correct answer is excited because Rat is happy and ready to go see Toad.

The creek is mentioned later—“Do you see that small creek on the left side?”—as a clue to the boathouse, not the main sight.

The text supports your answer: “Soon they could see a beautiful, grand old house.” When answering similar questions, scan for sentences that directly tell who, what, or where, and match those words to the answer choices.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600339\">\n        The stables over there\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600339\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on a side detail, but look at “Soon they could see a beautiful, grand old house,” while “The stables are over there” is just Rat pointing out a location. This shows the main thing they saw was the house, so the correct answer is “A beautiful old house.” Next time, reread the first describing sentence and choose the answer that matches what the characters notice first, not a later detail.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

The text shows this when it says “Mole was very excited” and Rat says, “I want to stay by my river… and go boating like I always do.” Next time, look at what each character says and does to see how their feelings are different.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600390\">\n        Mole wants to help Toad, but Rat thinks Toad is being selfish\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600390\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have added ideas not in the text—Rat never says Toad is selfish, and Mole isn’t trying to help Toad; he says, “I’ll stick with you, Rat,” while also whispering, “it does sound like it might be fun.” Rat clearly says, “I want to stay by my river,” showing he wants to stay home, while Mole is excited about the trip. So the correct idea is: Mole thinks the trip sounds fun, but Rat wants to stay by his river. Strategy: Reread the lines that show each character’s feelings and pick the answer that matches their exact words.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

Next time, reread the key lines and ask, “What problem is the character feeling inside?” and look for clue words like loyal and tempting.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600396\">\n        All three friends want different things, so they decide to split up permanently\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600396\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have thought they split up for good, but the text says, “We don’t have to decide right now,” and Mole says, “I’ll stick with you, Rat,” which shows they stay together and haven’t decided to split. The real problem is inside Mole: he wants to be loyal to Rat but also wants the adventure—“But it does sound like it might be fun.” Next time, reread the key lines and look for clue words like “loyal” and “tempting” to be sure your answer matches what the text actually says, not a guess about what might happen.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600395\">\n        Rat's anger about the wagon makes Toad want to find new friends for his trip\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600395\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on Rat’s anger and guessed Toad would look for new friends, but look at Rat saying, 'I'm not coming… Mole is going to stay with me,' and Toad begging, 'You have to come with me,' which shows Toad still wants Rat and Mole, not new friends. To find the right answer, notice Mole says, 'Of course I’ll stick with you, Rat,' but also, 'it might be fun,' so his loyalty to Rat goes against his wish for adventure. Next time, reread what each character says and ask, “What is the main problem between the characters?” not just how one feels.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600394\">\n        Mole's loyalty to Rat conflicts with his desire for adventure\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600394\" show-hide=\"show\">You successfully identified a character’s conflict by noticing that Mole wants two different things. The text shows this when he says, “Of course I’ll stick with you, Rat,” but then adds, “it does sound like it might be fun,” and the narrator notes the adventure was “very exciting and tempting.” Next time, look for what a character wants and what gets in the way to find the problem in the story.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

Here, a narrator tells what happens—“Lunch was wonderful at Toad Hall” and “He told Mole all about the fun they would have”—so the correct answer is “a story.” Next time, check the format: look for speaker labels or stage directions to see if it’s a play.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600397\">\n        a poem\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600397\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have thought it was a poem because of the title, but the passage uses sentences and paragraphs to tell what characters do—“Toad talked to Mole…” and “they loaded up the wagon and set off”—not short lines or stanzas. That means the correct answer is a story, since it narrates events in order with characters (Toad, Mole, Rat). Strategy: Check the text’s structure—poems have line breaks and often rhyme, while stories have paragraphs, characters, and a sequence of events.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600398\">\n        a story\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600398\" show-hide=\"show\">You successfully identified the text type by noticing story elements like characters, a setting, and events. The text supports this when it says, “Toad talked to Mole about taking a trip… after lunch, they loaded up the wagon and set off on their adventure,” which shows a sequence of actions with characters. Remember to look for who the characters are, where they are, and what happens first, next, and last to tell if a passage is a story.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600400\">\n        a report\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600400\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have picked “a report” because it’s about a trip, but look at “Lunch was wonderful at Toad Hall,” “He told Mole all about the fun,” “Mole got so excited,” and “they set off on their adventure”—these show characters, feelings, and events happening, not just facts. That means the passage is a story, because it tells what Toad, Mole, and Rat did and how they felt.

The correct answer is “selfish” because the drivers caused trouble and didn’t stop to help.

You road hogs!” after the car scares the horse and crashes their wagon—Rat is upset because the drivers were selfish, taking the road for themselves. The correct idea is selfish, not hungry.

The drivers seem selfish because the car “threw a huge cloud of dust,” their wagon fell “on its side in the ditch,” and the car just “got smaller and smaller” as it drove away without helping. Next time, look at what characters do and how their actions affect others, and ask, “What does this show about what they care about?”</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600411\">\n        farmers\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600411\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have chosen “farmers” because it names a type of person, but the story never says the people in the car are farmers. Look at “You mean drivers! You road hogs!” and how the car scared the horse and sped away—this shows the drivers were being selfish, so the correct answer is “selfish.” Next time, make sure your answer is a describing word that fits how the characters act, and use the clues the text gives you.</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n    </qti-choice-interaction>\n  </qti-item-body>\n  <qti-response-processing>\n    <qti-response-condition>\n      <qti-response-if>\n        <qti-match>\n          <qti-variable identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n          <qti-correct identifier=\"RESPONSE\"/>\n        </qti-match>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">CORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">1</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-if>\n      <qti-response-else>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"FEEDBACK\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"identifier\">INCORRECT</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n        <qti-set-outcome-value identifier=\"SCORE\">\n          <qti-base-value base-type=\"float\">0</qti-base-value>\n        </qti-set-outcome-value>\n      </qti-response-else>\n    </qti-response-condition>\n  </qti-response-processing>\n</qti-assessment-item>"

So after lunch, they loaded up the wagon,” showing loading the wagon happened later, not what convinced them.

The text supports this: “He told Mole all about the fun they would have on the open road… He made it sound like the best thing in the world.” When you answer similar questions, look for cause-and-effect clues—ask, “What did the character say or do that made this happen?”</qti-feedback-inline>\n      </qti-simple-choice>\n      <qti-simple-choice identifier=\"answer_600415\">\n        showing them his beautiful yellow wagon.\n        <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier=\"FEEDBACK-INLINE\" identifier=\"answer_600415\" show-hide=\"show\">You may have focused on the wagon because the text says “some people stopped to say nice things about their beautiful wagon,” but that happens after they already started the trip. In the lunch scene, “He told Mole all about the fun they would have” and Toad “was very good at talking people into things,” so the correct answer is telling them about the fun they would have.

This shows the author is highlighting how different the fancy motor car was from the friends’ simple wagon, which is why that answer fits best.
