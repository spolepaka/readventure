Distractor A mistakenly characterizes the elephants, which contradicts their description as 'special forces' in the text. Distractor B inaccurately states the condition of the Alps, which were described as having no big roads and only a few slippery paths. Distractor C suggests an expectation by the Romans which is neither supported nor refuted by the text, hence unlikely to be confused with the notion of an unexpected and dangerous crossing. The correct answer, D, distinctively focuses on the unexpected nature and the peril of crossing the mountains, which is clearly supported by the text.",

Understanding such a nuanced lesson without explicit emphasis within the text on reciprocal mercy might demand cognitive and empathetic skills more developed than those typically expected of grade 3 students. Additionally, the vocabulary and the setting of ancient Rome with its specific cultural practices (e.g., Colosseum fights) might not be readily accessible without additional context or explanation for younger children.",
