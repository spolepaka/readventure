The text indicates that Aladdin rubbed the ring WHILE praying, not BECAUSE he was praying. The rubbing appears to be accidental - a consequence of putting his hands together, not his intention. The question asks 'Why does Aladdin rub the ring?' which could be interpreted as asking for his intentional purpose (which would be 'none' since it was accidental) or the circumstances during which it happened (praying). This ambiguity makes the question unclear.",

This suggests the rubbing was an accidental byproduct of praying, not the reason itself. Choice D ('He hopes to find a way out') is also defensible because the passage shows Aladdin had been trying to escape for three days (yelling, crying, then praying), so his broader motivation for all actions, including praying, was to escape.
