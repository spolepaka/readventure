Some astronauts do! The United States and other countries use the space shuttle to send astronauts to a special place called the International Space Station. This space station moves around Earth in a big circle. It is like a house floating in space. Three astronauts can live there at one time. They stay for six months before coming back to Earth.\nThe space station moves very far above our planet. It is so far up that the astronauts don't feel gravity like we do down here. Gravity is the force that pulls things down to Earth. When we lift our arms and legs on Earth, we have to work against gravity pulling us down. This is good for our bodies because it helps keep our muscles strong. But astronauts in space don't have gravity to work against. They float around instead of walking. This means they don't get much exercise just moving around. They have to run on a special machine at least once every day to keep their muscles strong and healthy.\n\n---\n\nSleeping in space is very different from sleeping in your bed at home. The astronauts don't feel gravity, so they float freely inside the space station. This means they can sleep right side up, upside down, or sideways. It doesn't matter which way they face because there is no up or down in space! They have to zip themselves into sleeping bags that are attached to the walls. Otherwise, they would float away while they sleep. Do you think you would like sleeping while floating in the air?\nTaking a shower in space is much harder than taking a shower at home. On Earth, water comes out of the shower head and falls down on your body because of gravity. Then the water runs off your skin and goes down the drain. But in space, water doesn't fall down at all! Instead, the water forms little floating bubbles. Astronauts have to catch the water and rub it on their skin with their hands. When they are done washing, the water doesn't drip off their bodies. They have to use special tools to scrape the water off their skin.\n\n---\n\nAstronauts must shower inside a small, closed room called a pod. This pod keeps all the water from floating away into the rest of the space station. If water bubbles floated around freely, they could cause big problems. The floating water might get into the computers and other important equipment. This could break the machines that keep the astronauts safe and healthy in space.\nYou can see that many things are different when people live in space instead of on Earth. That is why leaving the space station and coming back to our planet can be very hard for astronauts. It takes time for them to get used to living on Earth again. After spending months floating in space, they have trouble with Earth's gravity. Their arms and legs feel very heavy and hard to move. They find it difficult to stand up without falling over. They feel like they might tip over when they try to walk. But after a few weeks back on Earth, their bodies remember how to work with gravity. They begin to feel normal again. Sometimes when they look up at the night sky, they even feel a little homesick for their floating home in outer space.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.8 -

This is what happens on Earth, not in space. The passage contrasts Earth and space, stating that on Earth water 'goes down the drain,' but space is different. Reread paragraph 4 to see what actually happens in space.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Water doesn't fall in space because there is no gravity. The passage explains that 'water doesn't fall down at all' in space. You may be thinking of what happens on Earth instead of in space.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct! The passage states 'When they are done washing, the water doesn't drip off their bodies. They have to use special tools to scrape the water off their skin.' This shows the sequence of what happens after washing.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Water forms bubbles before washing, not after.

Sleep is affected by lack of gravity, but this is not described as a problem. The passage mentions sleeping differently, not sleeping improperly. Look for what the passage identifies as negative effects.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The passage explains 'astronauts in space don't have gravity to work against. They float around instead of walking. This means they don't get much exercise just moving around.' This cause-effect shows lack of gravity prevents normal muscle exercise.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Homesickness happens after returning to Earth, not while in space. This reverses the timeline. Paragraph 6 discusses feelings after coming back to Earth, not problems caused by lack of gravity.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While showering is harder in space, the passage doesn't connect this difficulty directly to not working against gravity.

While they may feel excited emotionally, the passage focuses on physical feelings, not emotions. Paragraph 6 describes physical difficulties like heaviness and trouble walking, not emotional reactions to being home.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The passage states 'They feel like they might tip over when they try to walk.' This describes their immediate physical experience when first attempting to walk after months in space without gravity.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Muscles getting stronger happens over weeks, not when they first try to walk. The passage explains 'after a few weeks' they feel normal, but immediately they have trouble. You may be confusing the beginning and end of the adjustment period.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This is the opposite of what happens.

This is background information about the station's orbit, not about astronaut adaptation to living differently.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct! This detail demonstrates adjustment because astronauts must do something different (run on a machine) to solve a problem caused by space conditions (lack of gravity exercise). The passage explains they need this 'at least once every day' because normal movement doesn't exercise muscles in space.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

Look for information about doing everyday things differently.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! This information demonstrates how space conditions change a daily activity (washing). The passage explains that because water floats instead of falls, astronauts must 'catch the water and rub it on their skin with their hands,' showing daily activities are performed differently.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. This states where the station is located, not how activities are affected. Location information doesn't show changes in performing tasks.

Water temperature is not mentioned in the passage. The passage focuses on controlling where water goes, not its temperature. Reread paragraph 5 to find the actual reason for using the closed pod.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The passage explains 'This pod keeps all the water from floating away into the rest of the space station' because 'floating water might get into the computers and other important equipment. This could break the machines.' This cause-effect chain shows the pod prevents equipment damage.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The passage doesn't mention making astronauts feel at home. The reason given relates to practical safety concerns about floating water, not comfort or familiarity. Look for the consequences mentioned if water floated freely.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The pod doesn't make water fall—water still floats inside the pod because gravity is still absent.

How astronauts travel to space doesn't demonstrate adapting to different conditions in each place. Focus on details about physical adjustment.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct!

He wanted to reach Asia by sailing west across the ocean. But Cabot had a different idea than Columbus. He thought the best way to get to Asia was to sail around the northern part of Earth. The distance around Earth is much shorter at the top than it is at the equator. This would substantially cut down the travel time. Like other explorers, Cabot wanted to find the Northwest Passage. This was supposed to be a shorter route from Europe to Asia.\nMany things about Cabot's life are still unknown today. He did not keep good records during his trips. However, we do know he was Italian and got help from King Henry VII of England. The king gave Cabot a charter, which was like a special permission paper. This charter let Cabot explore new lands and claim them for England.\n\n---\n\nCabot made his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage in 1496. This trip was not successful. He had fights with some of his crew members. There was also a shortage of food, and they ran into terrible weather. Cabot decided to turn around and go back to England.\nIn 1497, Cabot tried again with one ship and 18 men. This time, he reached land that he thought was Asia. But this land was actually the coast of North America. Nobody knows exactly where he first saw land. It might have been near Newfoundland. During this trip, Cabot found an area of shallow water that had lots of fish. This area is called the Grand Banks, and it is still a great fishing spot today. Cabot and his men were some of the first Europeans to see the landmass we now call North America.\n\n---\n\nCabot sailed back to England with exciting news. He was sure he had found a new, shorter route to Asia. This helped him get support for another, much larger expedition. This trip left England in 1498, but the ships never came back. Nobody knows what happened to Cabot and his men. Later, people realized that Cabot had not really found the Northwest Passage. But England used Cabot's trips to make claims to North American territory. When Cabot first saw land, he went ashore and claimed it for England.\n\n---\n\nLife on sailing ships was very hard. Young boys worked as pages for the captain. They carried messages, cleaned the deck, and helped serve food. Older boys had to work the bilge pump. This pump removed water that leaked into the ship. It was a terrible job because the water smelled awful and made sailors sick.\nThe food on ships was also bad. Most of the time, sailors ate hardtack. This was bread that was baked many times until it became very hard. Sailors had to soak it in water to make it soft enough to eat. The good thing about hardtack was that it would not spoil on long trips. But if it got wet, bugs called weevils could get into it. Many sailors got sick from eating such poor food. Lots of them got a disease called scurvy. Today we know that scurvy happens when people don't eat enough fresh fruits and vegetables. Back then, people didn't know this, so many sailors died from this disease.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, easy):\n- Standard: RI.3.6 - Distinguish their own point of view from that of the author of a text.\n- Question: What was one important result of Cabot’s trips, even though he did not find Asia?\n- A) England used his trips to claim land in North America.\n- B) He found a short route to Asia that many sailors used.\n- C) He kept perfect records, so people know every detail of his life.\n- D) He brought plenty of fresh food, so no sailors got sick.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty easy, CCSS RI.3.6.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.8 - Describe the logical connection between particular sentences and paragraphs in a text (e.g., comparison, cause/effect, first/second/third in a sequence).\n- Question: What is the connection between the sentences in section 2 about Cabot's first attempt in 1496?\n- A) cause and effect\n- B) comparison and contrast\n- C) sequence of steps\n- D) question and answer\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 3, difficulty medium, CCSS RI.3.8.**\n\nDOK 3 Requirements for siblings:\n- Require strategic thinking and reasoning\n- Analyze, evaluate, or synthesize information\n- Draw conclusions based on multiple pieces of evidence\n- Make complex inferences or connections\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.1 - Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers.\n- Question: Why was John Cabot's 1497 voyage still important to England, even though he did not reach Asia?\n- A) He brought back ships full of gold and spices\n- B) He found rich fishing waters near Newfoundland\n- C) He proved the Northwest Passage was real\n- D) He discovered a short sea route to Asia\n- Correct: B\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RI.3.1.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 4 (DOK 3, medium):\n- Standard: RI.3.2 - Determine the main idea of a text;

The passage shows the opposite—Cabot didn't reach Asia but still helped England claim North American territory and discovered valuable fishing areas. The author emphasizes that even failed missions had significance, contradicting the idea that failures contributed nothing.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The passage demonstrates this theme throughout: Cabot sought Asia but found North America, didn't find the Northwest Passage but gave England territorial claims, and discovered valuable fishing grounds while pursuing a different goal. By synthesizing these examples, you recognize the author's broader message about how exploration outcomes often differed from intentions but still mattered.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the Northwest Passage was a goal, the author never argues it was more important than other discoveries. The passage actually emphasizes how Cabot's 'unintended' discoveries—land claims and fishing areas—were valuable, suggesting all discoveries had worth.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Record-keeping is mentioned as a problem with studying Cabot, but the author doesn't present it as the most important aspect of exploration.

Claiming land for England shows he took official action, but doesn't reveal what he believed about whether he'd reached his goal of finding a route to Asia. This describes an action, not his belief about success.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The phrase 'was sure' directly tells us Cabot's belief—he was certain he had accomplished his goal of finding a shorter route to Asia. This explicit statement from paragraph 3 best demonstrates his conviction that he had succeeded, showing you can identify which detail most directly supports a claim about someone's beliefs.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Finding fishing areas was a discovery Cabot made, but it wasn't his main goal. His goal was to reach Asia and find the Northwest Passage, not to discover fishing spots. This detail shows what he found, not what he believed about his main mission.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The passage states sailors did eat hardtack—they had to soak it to soften it.

The passage states: 'Today we know that scurvy happens when people don't eat enough fresh fruits and vegetables. Back then, people didn't know this, so many sailors died from this disease.'
