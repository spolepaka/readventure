This question asks about the speaker's feelings toward a place, which is more aligned with inferring character emotions (RL.4.1/4.3) rather than analyzing point of view",
          "difficulty_assessment": "The passage contains complex historical context and abstract concepts like emancipation, inequality, and systemic injustice, which may be challenging for a Grade 3 level. Additionally, vocabulary such as 'emancipated', 'enslaved', and 'constellation' could be too advanced, making it hard for young students to fully grasp the nuances of the speaker's pride without additional explanation.",
