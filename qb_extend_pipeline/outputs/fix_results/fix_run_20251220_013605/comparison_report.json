Option B ('always involve magic and require special rings') is obviously wrong because it takes literal story details and presents them as a universal truth. Options C and D similarly take specific plot elements (mountain climbing, long-lost family) and frame them as general patterns, making them obviously implausible as real-world lessons.",
          "homogeneity": "The choices do not belong to the same conceptual category. Option A presents a generalizable life lesson/moral about human motivation. Options B, C, and D present literal story details framed as general patterns. This creates a category mismatch - one is a thematic interpretation while the others are superficial plot summaries presented as lessons.",
          "specificity_balance": "There is significant imbalance in specificity. Option A is appropriately general and abstract (a universal life lesson). Options B, C, and D are overly specific, incorporating particular story details (magic, rings, mountains, long-lost family members) that don't translate to general lessons, making them much more concrete than option A."
