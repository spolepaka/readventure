Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me.

But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy.

When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy.

This requires sophisticated analysis of how the author uses plot structure to reveal character truth. Throughout the story, the magician made promises: to be family, to help Aladdin 'become a merchant and earn good money,' and that the treasure would make Aladdin 'richer than any king.' However, the text reveals 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp.' When Aladdin couldn't immediately hand it over, the magician's instant response - trapping him without hesitation - reveals that none of his promises were genuine. The author structures the story so the magician's true nature is revealed at the climax, showing his promises were manipulation tactics from the beginning.","Incorrect. The magician's immediate and final action (sealing Aladdin in the cave) shows no intention of returning or keeping promises. The text states he 'only cared about getting the magic lamp,' and his instant abandonment proves his promises were never real. There is no evidence suggesting he will calm down and return. The author uses this definitive action to reveal the truth about the character's intentions.","Incorrect. Aladdin did not disobey - he said 'I cannot reach it right now' and offered to give the lamp after climbing out, which was reasonable since his heavy bag made climbing difficult. The author reveals the magician 'only cared about getting the magic lamp,' showing his promises were never real to begin with. His instant trapping of Aladdin reveals his selfish nature was there from the start, not a change caused by Aladdin's behavior.",Incorrect. The text explicitly states 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' and that he 'only cared about getting the magic lamp.' The author reveals the magician had been deceiving Aladdin from their first meeting. His immediate abandonment of Aladdin - with no hesitation or regret shown - proves he never cared about Aladdin. This was not a mistake but the revelation of his true selfish character that the author built toward throughout the story.,3,hard,RL.3.2,3,quiz_302008,2025-12-11T20:02:03.882724,"Analyzes how author uses climactic plot event to reveal truth about earlier promises requiring synthesis of paragraphs 2, 4, and 5 - differs by examining authorial technique of using plot structure to reveal character truth",,all choices are interpretations of what the trap reveals about promises,all at similar detail level analyzing promise authenticity,"A:14 words, B:13 words, C:14 words, D:12 words - within 10%",distinct interpretations: never genuine vs future keeping vs changed mind vs caring mistake,only A recognizes author's use of climax to reveal manipulation from beginning,"analyzes authorial technique using plot structure across paragraphs 2, 4, and 5 - completely different from all other variants using 'By having...what does the author reveal' meta-analytical stem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.""What do you wish for?"" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, ""Take me out of this cave!"" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

---

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.""What is your wish?"" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.

---

One day, Aladdin told his mother, ""I want to marry the Sultan's daughter."" His mother laughed. ""Have you lost your mind?"" she said. ""Your father was just a poor tailor!"" But Aladdin said, ""Remember those shiny gems from the cave? Take them as a gift to the Sultan.""Aladdin's mother went to see the Sultan. ""My lord,"" she said, ""my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter."" The Sultan laughed loudly. ""Your son and my daughter? That's silly!"" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought. ""I have never seen such beautiful gems!"" Then the Sultan said, ""Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.""

When Aladdin heard this, he rubbed his magic lamp. The genie appeared right away. Aladdin told the genie what the Sultan wanted. Almost instantly, the genie brought forty servants. Each servant carried a large golden bowl. Half the bowls were filled with pearls and diamonds. The other bowls were filled with rubies and emeralds.The Sultan was amazed by all the treasure.

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.""What do you wish for?"" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, ""Take me out of this cave!"" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.""What is your wish?"" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.

One day, Aladdin told his mother, ""I want to marry the Sultan's daughter."" His mother laughed. ""Have you lost your mind?"" she said. ""Your father was just a poor tailor!"" But Aladdin said, ""Remember those shiny gems from the cave? Take them as a gift to the Sultan.""Aladdin's mother went to see the Sultan. ""My lord,"" she said, ""my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter."" The Sultan laughed loudly. ""Your son and my daughter? That's silly!"" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought. ""I have never seen such beautiful gems!"" Then the Sultan said, ""Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.""

""My lord,"" she said, ""my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter."" The Sultan laughed loudly. ""Your son and my daughter? That's silly!"" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought.
