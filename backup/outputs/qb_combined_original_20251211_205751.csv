        There once was a poor boy named Aladdin. His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

---

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.",,,,,"In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him ""richer than any king in the world.""What does this phrase mean?",MCQ,Aladdin will have more money than he can count,Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom,Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave,Aladdin will meet kings from other countries,A,You successfully made a good prediction by using clues about the magic lamp and treasure. The text supports this when it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the magician promises it “will make you richer than any king in the world.” Remember to look for repeated hints and strong words like “will” to predict what will happen next.,"You may have thought “richer than any king” means Aladdin becomes a king, or you used what you know from other versions, but the text says the lamp “would make any person very rich” and “It will make you richer than any king,” which is about money, not ruling. So the correct answer is that Aladdin will have more money than he can count. Strategy: Reread and underline clue words like “rich/richer,” and choose the answer that matches exactly what the passage says—not what you expect from outside the story.","You may have brought in outside ideas (gold coins), but the text never mentions coins—Aladdin finds “beautiful gems,” and the lamp is said to make a person “very rich,” even “richer than any king.” That means the best prediction is about how much wealth he will have, not a specific kind of money, so “Aladdin will have more money than he can count” fits the text. Next time, stick to the exact words and look for clue phrases about the main idea, like “very rich.”","You may have focused on the word “king” and guessed he’d meet kings, but the text never says Aladdin will meet any kings; it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the treasure “will make you richer than any king in the world.” That evidence points to the correct answer: Aladdin will have more money than he can count. Strategy: reread for clue words and choose the option that matches what the passage actually says, not ideas it doesn’t mention.",2,medium,RL.3.4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,original

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy.

The magician already has magical powers from North Africa - he doesn't need to learn from Aladdin's family. In fact, paragraph 2 says he's 'a powerful magician' who came TO Persia with his knowledge. The false uncle claim serves a different purpose.","Correct! The magician's deception creates trust that enables his plan. Paragraph 2 shows that when he 'promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant,' the mother 'believed his words.' This trust allowed him to take Aladdin to the mountain the next day. By pretending to be family, he eliminated the mother's natural caution about a stranger taking her son away. This connection between deception and achieving his goal shows strategic manipulation.","Incorrect. The magician already knew where the lamp was before meeting Aladdin - that's why he traveled from North Africa to this specific location. He needed Aladdin to RETRIEVE the lamp, not to show him where it was. The false family claim served a different purpose.","Incorrect. The magician doesn't want gems - he only wants the lamp.

While asking adults is generally good advice, this isn't the story's central message. The story shows that Aladdin DID involve his mother, but she was also deceived. The lesson is about the deception itself, not about getting parental permission for adventures.",Correct! The entire story illustrates this message through cause and effect. The magician's promise that finding the lamp would make Aladdin 'richer than any king' seemed too good to be true - and it was. The mother and Aladdin didn't think carefully about why a stranger would offer such incredible help. This lack of critical thinking led to Aladdin being trapped.
