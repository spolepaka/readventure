        There once was a poor boy named Aladdin. His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""",RL.3.1,1,3,"You may have chosen baker because it’s a common job, but look at the lines, “His father worked as a tailor,” and, “Are you the son of the tailor?”—baker is never mentioned. The correct answer is tailor because the text names it twice. Next time, reread for exact clue words and pick the word the text repeats.","You successfully identified key details by picking “tailor” as Aladdin’s father’s job. The text supports this when it says, “His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people,” and again when the stranger asks, “Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?” Remember to look for sentences that directly answer the question and repeat key words from the question in the passage.","You may have guessed “farmer” or mixed it up with another story, but the text clearly says, “His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people,” and the stranger asks, “Are you the son of the tailor?”—so the father was a tailor, not a farmer. The correct answer is tailor because the story states it twice. Next time, reread the sentence that answers the question and underline the exact words from the text before choosing.","You may have mixed up the job words and chose “teacher,” but the story says his father worked as a tailor, and the stranger asks if Aladdin is the son of the tailor. This shows the correct answer is tailor, not teacher. Next time, reread and match your answer to the exact word the story uses."
guiding_21015_302002,Which word describes how Aladdin's mother most likely feels about meeting the stranger?,MCQ,bored,angry,excited,surprised,D,"Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.",RL.3.3,1,3,"You may have guessed she was bored, but the text says, “She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother,” which does not match “bored.” The right answer is “surprised” because the passage states it directly and explains why. Next time, reread the sentence that tells how the character feels and choose the word that matches it exactly.","You may have guessed she was angry because a stranger came, but the story doesn’t say that. It says, “She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother,” so the correct answer is surprised, not angry. Next time, reread the sentence with feeling words and pick the word that matches what the text says.","You may have focused on the promise of good money and her welcoming him, which can sound exciting, but the text says, “She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother,” so the correct answer is surprised. To find the right answer, look for the exact sentence that tells how the character feels and match your choice to that word.","Great job identifying a key detail about the character’s feelings. The text says, “She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother.” Next time, look for feeling words and the reason that follows to confirm your answer."

Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks.

There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.",RL.3.5,2,3,"You may have focused on an early detail (the magician visiting), but the text says he “spoke magical words in a loud voice.

The text supports this: “he… spoke magical words in a loud voice.

Suddenly… The earth split open right at their feet,” showing the words caused it—not Aladdin gathering sticks. The correct answer is “words make the earth split open.” Strategy: Reread the lines around the big event and pick the cause the text points to, not an earlier step."

Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.",RL.3.6,2,3,"You may have focused on the detail of Aladdin finding the lamp, but the story isn’t a how-to; it shows what happens because of choices. Look at “He only cared about getting the magic lamp… he spoke a magic spell… Poor Aladdin was trapped”—the magician’s greed causes trouble. So the best answer is that the story teaches that greed can lead to trouble; next time, ask, What lesson do the characters learn from what happens?","You may have focused on the shiny gems and thought the author wants to interest readers in collecting them, but the text shows the opposite: “all those gems made his bag very heavy” so Aladdin couldn’t climb out, and the magician “only cared about getting the magic lamp” and trapped him. These details teach that greed leads to trouble, which is the main message. Next time, ask yourself, “Do the events show a benefit or a warning?” and choose the answer that matches the lesson of the whole passage.","Great job—you found the story’s lesson (theme) by noticing how greed leads to problems. The text shows this when “Aladdin…filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy…he could not pull himself out,” and when the magician “only cared about getting the magic lamp” and trapped Aladdin. Next time, look for warnings and then see what trouble follows a character’s choice to want too much to spot the theme.","You may have focused on the magician’s feelings instead of the main idea, but the text says ""The magician grew very angry... He only cared about getting the magic lamp"" and even says ""Poor Aladdin,"" so we are not meant to feel sorry for the magician.

Strategy: Reread and underline clue words like “rich/richer,” and choose the answer that matches exactly what the passage says—not what you expect from outside the story.","You may have brought in outside ideas (gold coins), but the text never mentions coins—Aladdin finds “beautiful gems,” and the lamp is said to make a person “very rich,” even “richer than any king.” That means the best prediction is about how much wealth he will have, not a specific kind of money, so “Aladdin will have more money than he can count” fits the text. Next time, stick to the exact words and look for clue phrases about the main idea, like “very rich.”","You may have focused on the word “king” and guessed he’d meet kings, but the text never says Aladdin will meet any kings; it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the treasure “will make you richer than any king in the world.” That evidence points to the correct answer: Aladdin will have more money than he can count.

The text supports this when it says he came “to search for a special magic lamp… [and] needed someone to help him,” and later he demands, “First, hand me the lamp.” Remember to ask yourself, “What does the character want?” and look for lines that state goals or demands when answering similar questions.","It looks like you focused on the long walk up the mountain, but the text says the magician came “to search for a special magic lamp,” told Aladdin “Bring that lamp back to me,” and “only cared about getting the magic lamp,” so his goal wasn’t the walk. The correct answer is that he took Aladdin to get him to bring the magic lamp. Next time, look for what the character wants most (the main goal) and make sure your answer matches that, not just one event."
