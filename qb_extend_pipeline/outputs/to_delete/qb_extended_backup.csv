""He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!""The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, ""New lamps for old lamps!""Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.""I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,"" she thought.

The princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.""Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,"" the magician commanded. ""Move it to my home in North Africa.""""I hear and I obey,"" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.""Find my daughter right now!"" the Sultan shouted. ""If you cannot bring her back, you will die!""

Poor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.""What do you wish?"" asked the genie of the ring.""Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,"" Aladdin begged.""I am sorry,"" said the genie. ""I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.""""Then please take me to be with my wife,"" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace.

What does the word hurried mean in this sentence?",MCQ,moved very slowly and carefully,moved very quickly,walked backward,jumped up and down,B,"This is incorrect.

The word 'hurried' describes the speed of movement (fast), not the direction. Walking backward is about direction, not speed.

Poor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.""What do you wish?"" asked the genie of the ring.""Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,"" Aladdin begged.""I am sorry,"" said the genie.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

---

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

Soon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom.
