        During the time when Emperor Augustus ruled Rome, something very important happened. Most people did not notice it then. A man named Jesus of Nazareth was born. Jesus was a Jewish man who became a great teacher. He walked around teaching crowds of people. People said that Jesus could do amazing things called miracles. They said he turned water into wine and walked on top of water. They said he made sick people well and brought dead people back to life.
Jesus had many followers who listened to his teachings. But he also got the attention of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. Pilate heard that Jesus called himself ""the king of the Jews."" This worried Pilate. The Jewish people in Palestine were subjects of the Roman Emperor. This meant they had to obey Roman rulers. There was no room for both a ""king"" and a Roman governor.

---

Pilate had Jesus arrested and put him on trial. A trial is when judges decide if someone broke the law. Pilate sentenced Jesus to death. Even after Jesus died, his followers still believed in him. They believed Jesus was a divine being, which means he was the son of God. They believed God had sent Jesus to Earth. They also believed that after Jesus died, God took him up to heaven.
The followers of Jesus were called Christians. The word comes from Christ, another name for Jesus. Christians believed Jesus was sent by God to save people. They began telling the story of Jesus to anyone who would listen. Many people thought they were crazy. But some people believed them. The Christian religion began to grow slowly.

---

One man helped spread Christianity more than anyone else. His name was Paul, and he was a Roman citizen. Paul traveled all around the Roman Empire, teaching people about Jesus. He started Christian churches in many cities. Eventually, Paul was killed like Jesus had been. But before he died, he had helped Christianity spread to many places.
At first, Roman emperors did not care about this new religion. Later, they began to worry about Christians. The Romans worshipped many gods like Jupiter, Juno, and Mars. Everyone in the Roman Empire was supposed to worship these gods. Romans believed these gods kept their empire safe and strong.

---

This created a big problem for Christians. They believed there was only one God. They thought it was wrong to worship Roman gods. For many years, Roman emperors treated Christians as enemies. They put Christians in jail and killed many of them. But Christians did not give up their faith. They kept believing and teaching about Jesus.
Everything changed with Emperor Constantine. He became emperor about three hundred years after Jesus was born. By then, there were many Christians in the empire. Constantine's own mother became a Christian. Constantine became a Christian too. When Constantine became emperor, he stopped punishing Christians. Instead, Christianity became the official religion of the entire Roman Empire.",,,,,"Based on the passage, what would the author most likely think about Paul's work?",MCQ,Paul was important for helping Christianity reach many people.,Paul was wrong to travel around the Roman Empire.,Paul should have stayed in one city instead of traveling.,Paul was less important than Emperor Constantine.,A,"Correct!

        During the time when Emperor Augustus ruled Rome, something very important happened. Most people did not notice it then. A man named Jesus of Nazareth was born. Jesus was a Jewish man who became a great teacher. He walked around teaching crowds of people. People said that Jesus could do amazing things called miracles. They said he turned water into wine and walked on top of water. They said he made sick people well and brought dead people back to life.
Jesus had many followers who listened to his teachings. But he also got the attention of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. Pilate heard that Jesus called himself ""the king of the Jews."" This worried Pilate. The Jewish people in Palestine were subjects of the Roman Emperor. This meant they had to obey Roman rulers. There was no room for both a ""king"" and a Roman governor.

---

Pilate had Jesus arrested and put him on trial. A trial is when judges decide if someone broke the law. Pilate sentenced Jesus to death. Even after Jesus died, his followers still believed in him. They believed Jesus was a divine being, which means he was the son of God. They believed God had sent Jesus to Earth. They also believed that after Jesus died, God took him up to heaven.
The followers of Jesus were called Christians. The word comes from Christ, another name for Jesus. Christians believed Jesus was sent by God to save people. They began telling the story of Jesus to anyone who would listen. Many people thought they were crazy. But some people believed them. The Christian religion began to grow slowly.

---

One man helped spread Christianity more than anyone else. His name was Paul, and he was a Roman citizen. Paul traveled all around the Roman Empire, teaching people about Jesus. He started Christian churches in many cities. Eventually, Paul was killed like Jesus had been. But before he died, he had helped Christianity spread to many places.
At first, Roman emperors did not care about this new religion. Later, they began to worry about Christians. The Romans worshipped many gods like Jupiter, Juno, and Mars. Everyone in the Roman Empire was supposed to worship these gods. Romans believed these gods kept their empire safe and strong.

---

This created a big problem for Christians. They believed there was only one God. They thought it was wrong to worship Roman gods. For many years, Roman emperors treated Christians as enemies. They put Christians in jail and killed many of them. But Christians did not give up their faith. They kept believing and teaching about Jesus.
Everything changed with Emperor Constantine. He became emperor about three hundred years after Jesus was born. By then, there were many Christians in the empire.

Jesus was a Jewish man who became a great teacher. He walked around teaching crowds of people. People said that Jesus could do amazing things called miracles. They said he turned water into wine and walked on top of water. They said he made sick people well and brought dead people back to life.
Jesus had many followers who listened to his teachings. But he also got the attention of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. Pilate heard that Jesus called himself ""the king of the Jews."" This worried Pilate. The Jewish people in Palestine were subjects of the Roman Emperor. This meant they had to obey Roman rulers. There was no room for both a ""king"" and a Roman governor.

---

Pilate had Jesus arrested and put him on trial. A trial is when judges decide if someone broke the law. Pilate sentenced Jesus to death. Even after Jesus died, his followers still believed in him. They believed Jesus was a divine being, which means he was the son of God. They believed God had sent Jesus to Earth. They also believed that after Jesus died, God took him up to heaven.
The followers of Jesus were called Christians. The word comes from Christ, another name for Jesus. Christians believed Jesus was sent by God to save people. They began telling the story of Jesus to anyone who would listen. Many people thought they were crazy. But some people believed them. The Christian religion began to grow slowly.

---

One man helped spread Christianity more than anyone else. His name was Paul, and he was a Roman citizen. Paul traveled all around the Roman Empire, teaching people about Jesus. He started Christian churches in many cities. Eventually, Paul was killed like Jesus had been. But before he died, he had helped Christianity spread to many places.
At first, Roman emperors did not care about this new religion. Later, they began to worry about Christians. The Romans worshipped many gods like Jupiter, Juno, and Mars. Everyone in the Roman Empire was supposed to worship these gods. Romans believed these gods kept their empire safe and strong.

---

This created a big problem for Christians. They believed there was only one God. They thought it was wrong to worship Roman gods. For many years, Roman emperors treated Christians as enemies. They put Christians in jail and killed many of them. But Christians did not give up their faith. They kept believing and teaching about Jesus.
Everything changed with Emperor Constantine. He became emperor about three hundred years after Jesus was born. By then, there were many Christians in the empire. Constantine's own mother became a Christian. Constantine became a Christian too. When Constantine became emperor, he stopped punishing Christians. Instead, Christianity became the official religion of the entire Roman Empire.",,,,,What is one main idea the passage develops about Christianity's growth in the Roman Empire?,MCQ,Christianity survived and eventually succeeded despite facing serious opposition.,Christianity grew only in areas where Roman gods were not worshipped.,Christianity replaced all other religions within one hundred years.,Christianity started because Roman emperors wanted a new religion.,A,"Correct!

        Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to help Christians. He made a new rule that said it was illegal to kill Christians or put them in jail. Constantine built churches all over his empire. He built one church in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. He built another church in Jerusalem, where Jesus died.
Constantine also built churches in Rome and in the old city of Byzantium. Byzantium was in what is now Turkey. This city was Constantine's favorite place. He loved it so much that he made it his own and gave it a new name. He called it Constantinople. Constantine wanted to make this city into a ""new Rome."" It would be like having Rome in a different place.

---

Constantine did not want Constantinople to take Rome's place. He hoped both cities would be strong together for many years. He wanted Rome and Constantinople to be like two mighty pillar stones holding up the Roman Empire. But in the end, one of those pillar stones fell down.
Later emperors thought the Roman Empire was too big for one person to rule. So they split it into two parts. The western half would be ruled from Rome. The eastern half would be ruled from Constantinople. This eastern part became known as the Eastern Empire.
Soon after this split, enemies from the north began attacking the Western Empire. Things got very bad. The attackers even came to Rome itself. Finally, the western part of the Roman Empire fell apart. But the Eastern Empire had better luck. It kept going and even got stronger for a while.

---

Most people who study history agree that the Eastern Empire was at its best when Justinian was emperor. Justinian became the ruler in the year 527 AD. This was 527 years after Jesus was born and about 200 years after Constantine started helping Christians.
Like Constantine, Justinian was a Christian too. He spent lots of money building beautiful churches. In Constantinople, he built the famous church called Hagia Sophia. This church had a huge, round dome that reached high into the sky. Artists made beautiful mosaic pictures on the walls using tiny colored stones.

---

Justinian also finished an important book project. He asked smart scholars to collect all the laws from the Roman Empire over many years. What these scholars found was a big mess. There were so many laws that nobody could remember them all. Some old laws did not make sense anymore. Some laws even said the opposite of other laws. One law might say ""you cannot do this thing."" But another law might say ""it is fine to do this same thing.""
Justinian had his scholar helpers gather all the laws, sort them out, and put them in order. When they finished their work, they made the laws into books. These new, organized laws were called Justinian's Code. This code helped people understand the laws much better than before.",,,,,"According to the passage, what did Constantine and Justinian both spend money on during their time as emperor?",MCQ,Creating new laws for the empire,Building churches in their territories,Fighting enemies from the north,Splitting the empire into parts,B,This is incorrect.

Constantine did not want Constantinople to take Rome's place. He hoped both cities would be strong together for many years. He wanted Rome and Constantinople to be like two mighty pillar stones holding up the Roman Empire. But in the end, one of those pillar stones fell down.
Later emperors thought the Roman Empire was too big for one person to rule. So they split it into two parts. The western half would be ruled from Rome. The eastern half would be ruled from Constantinople. This eastern part became known as the Eastern Empire.
Soon after this split, enemies from the north began attacking the Western Empire. Things got very bad. The attackers even came to Rome itself. Finally, the western part of the Roman Empire fell apart. But the Eastern Empire had better luck. It kept going and even got stronger for a while.

Most people who study history agree that the Eastern Empire was at its best when Justinian was emperor. Justinian became the ruler in the year 527 AD. This was 527 years after Jesus was born and about 200 years after Constantine started helping Christians.
Like Constantine, Justinian was a Christian too. He spent lots of money building beautiful churches. In Constantinople, he built the famous church called Hagia Sophia. This church had a huge, round dome that reached high into the sky. Artists made beautiful mosaic pictures on the walls using tiny colored stones.

        Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to help Christians. He made a new rule that said it was illegal to kill Christians or put them in jail. Constantine built churches all over his empire. He built one church in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. He built another church in Jerusalem, where Jesus died.
Constantine also built churches in Rome and in the old city of Byzantium. Byzantium was in what is now Turkey. This city was Constantine's favorite place. He loved it so much that he made it his own and gave it a new name. He called it Constantinople. Constantine wanted to make this city into a ""new Rome."" It would be like having Rome in a different place.

---

Constantine did not want Constantinople to take Rome's place. He hoped both cities would be strong together for many years. He wanted Rome and Constantinople to be like two mighty pillar stones holding up the Roman Empire. But in the end, one of those pillar stones fell down.
Later emperors thought the Roman Empire was too big for one person to rule. So they split it into two parts. The western half would be ruled from Rome. The eastern half would be ruled from Constantinople. This eastern part became known as the Eastern Empire.
Soon after this split, enemies from the north began attacking the Western Empire. Things got very bad. The attackers even came to Rome itself. Finally, the western part of the Roman Empire fell apart. But the Eastern Empire had better luck. It kept going and even got stronger for a while.

---

Most people who study history agree that the Eastern Empire was at its best when Justinian was emperor. Justinian became the ruler in the year 527 AD. This was 527 years after Jesus was born and about 200 years after Constantine started helping Christians.
Like Constantine, Justinian was a Christian too. He spent lots of money building beautiful churches. In Constantinople, he built the famous church called Hagia Sophia. This church had a huge, round dome that reached high into the sky. Artists made beautiful mosaic pictures on the walls using tiny colored stones.

        August 24th in the year AD 79 started like any normal day. The people of Pompeii woke up and went to work in their busy market town. The market was full of people buying and selling goods. In the distance, everyone could see the top of Mount Vesuvius. This mountain looked down on their city every single day. The people thought of it like an old friend watching over them. But this friend was hiding a dangerous secret.
The people of Pompeii did not know that Mount Vesuvius was really a volcano. Deep inside the mountain, melted rock and hot gas had been building up pressure for hundreds of years. The mountain looked peaceful, but it was getting ready to explode.

---

Around noon, the ground started to shake and tremble. Then everyone heard a loud cracking sound. Boom! Flames and smoke burst from the top of Mount Vesuvius. People looked up and saw a huge plume of black smoke rising high into the sky. The plume looked like a giant tree made of smoke and ash.
Soon, things began falling from the sky like deadly snow. Flakes of ash and small rocks called pumice showered down on the city. The pumice stones were light but sharp. People put pillows and blankets over their heads to protect themselves from the falling rocks. Many families tried to run away from the city as fast as they could.

---

The ash and pumice kept falling for hours. Then something even more terrible happened. A great cloud of hot rock mixed with burning gas poured out of the mountain. This deadly cloud raced down the mountainside at 60 miles per hour. The rocks and gas were heated to 400 degrees. The people of Pompeii could not run fast enough to escape it. The burning cloud swept over them and destroyed their entire city.
The volcano kept erupting for 19 long hours. When it finally stopped, the city of Pompeii was completely buried under ash. In some places, the ash was more than 80 inches deep! The whole city disappeared, and most people forgot it had ever existed.

        August 24th in the year AD 79 started like any normal day. The people of Pompeii woke up and went to work in their busy market town. The market was full of people buying and selling goods. In the distance, everyone could see the top of Mount Vesuvius. This mountain looked down on their city every single day. The people thought of it like an old friend watching over them. But this friend was hiding a dangerous secret.
The people of Pompeii did not know that Mount Vesuvius was really a volcano. Deep inside the mountain, melted rock and hot gas had been building up pressure for hundreds of years. The mountain looked peaceful, but it was getting ready to explode.

---

Around noon, the ground started to shake and tremble. Then everyone heard a loud cracking sound. Boom! Flames and smoke burst from the top of Mount Vesuvius. People looked up and saw a huge plume of black smoke rising high into the sky. The plume looked like a giant tree made of smoke and ash.
Soon, things began falling from the sky like deadly snow. Flakes of ash and small rocks called pumice showered down on the city. The pumice stones were light but sharp. People put pillows and blankets over their heads to protect themselves from the falling rocks. Many families tried to run away from the city as fast as they could.

---

The ash and pumice kept falling for hours. Then something even more terrible happened. A great cloud of hot rock mixed with burning gas poured out of the mountain. This deadly cloud raced down the mountainside at 60 miles per hour. The rocks and gas were heated to 400 degrees. The people of Pompeii could not run fast enough to escape it. The burning cloud swept over them and destroyed their entire city.
The volcano kept erupting for 19 long hours. When it finally stopped, the city of Pompeii was completely buried under ash. In some places, the ash was more than 80 inches deep! The whole city disappeared, and most people forgot it had ever existed.

        August 24th in the year AD 79 started like any normal day. The people of Pompeii woke up and went to work in their busy market town. The market was full of people buying and selling goods. In the distance, everyone could see the top of Mount Vesuvius. This mountain looked down on their city every single day. The people thought of it like an old friend watching over them. But this friend was hiding a dangerous secret.
The people of Pompeii did not know that Mount Vesuvius was really a volcano. Deep inside the mountain, melted rock and hot gas had been building up pressure for hundreds of years. The mountain looked peaceful, but it was getting ready to explode.

---

Around noon, the ground started to shake and tremble. Then everyone heard a loud cracking sound. Boom! Flames and smoke burst from the top of Mount Vesuvius. People looked up and saw a huge plume of black smoke rising high into the sky. The plume looked like a giant tree made of smoke and ash.
Soon, things began falling from the sky like deadly snow. Flakes of ash and small rocks called pumice showered down on the city. The pumice stones were light but sharp. People put pillows and blankets over their heads to protect themselves from the falling rocks. Many families tried to run away from the city as fast as they could.

---

The ash and pumice kept falling for hours. Then something even more terrible happened. A great cloud of hot rock mixed with burning gas poured out of the mountain.

        In the early days of the Roman Republic, Rome was in great danger. The kings had been driven out, but they wanted to come back and rule again. King Tarquin's son, Sextus, went to an area north of Rome. He helped an Etruscan king build a huge army. Then the two of them marched toward Rome to attack the city. They led their army all the way to the Tiber River right outside Rome's walls.
The men of Rome held an important meeting. They knew there was only one way to save their city. They had to tear down the bridge over the Tiber River. If the Etruscan army crossed that bridge, Rome would be lost forever. But if the Romans could destroy the bridge, the enemy soldiers would not be able to cross the river and enter their city.

---

The consul spoke to all the people gathered there. ""Which of you will stand and fight the Etruscans while we tear down the bridge?"" he asked. Then a brave Roman soldier named Horatius stepped forward. He spoke these words: ""Death comes to all men sooner or later. How can a man die better than facing terrible danger for his fathers' memory, for his gods' temples, and for his family? Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, as fast as you can. I will take two more men to help me. We will hold back the enemy. In that narrow path, three men can stop a thousand. Who will stand beside me and help keep the bridge?""
Two more brave men came forward to join Horatius. While the other Romans began chopping down the bridge with axes and hammers, these three warriors went out to face the entire Etruscan army by themselves.

---

The Etruscans laughed when they saw only three Romans blocking their way. They thought victory would be easy. First, they sent three of their best fighters into battle. The Romans threw one Etruscan off the bridge and killed the other two. Then the Etruscans sent three more warriors. Again, the Romans defeated them all. Finally, the Etruscans sent their bravest and strongest fighter. His name was Astur. He swung his sharp sword and wounded Horatius in the leg. Horatius fell back on one knee for just a moment. Then he jumped up and charged forward like a wild cat. He drove his sword right through Astur's helmet. The great Etruscan warrior fell to the ground with a terrible crash!
Just then, the bridge began to shake and fall apart. The two Romans helping Horatius ran back across the bridge to safety. Horatius tried to follow them, but the bridge collapsed before he could cross. Now he was alone, facing thousands of angry enemy soldiers!

---

Horatius prayed to the river god: ""Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber! Please save a Roman's life today!"" Then he jumped into the rushing river. His heavy armor made it very hard to swim. He almost drowned in the deep, fast-moving water. But he fought against the current and finally made it across the river to Rome. The people welcomed him as a great hero.
The grateful people of Rome gave Horatius a farm as a reward. They also built a statue of him and placed it where everyone could see it. The statue showed Horatius in his armor, kneeling on one knee.

        In the early days of the Roman Republic, Rome was in great danger. The kings had been driven out, but they wanted to come back and rule again. King Tarquin's son, Sextus, went to an area north of Rome. He helped an Etruscan king build a huge army. Then the two of them marched toward Rome to attack the city. They led their army all the way to the Tiber River right outside Rome's walls.
The men of Rome held an important meeting. They knew there was only one way to save their city. They had to tear down the bridge over the Tiber River. If the Etruscan army crossed that bridge, Rome would be lost forever. But if the Romans could destroy the bridge, the enemy soldiers would not be able to cross the river and enter their city.

---

The consul spoke to all the people gathered there. ""Which of you will stand and fight the Etruscans while we tear down the bridge?"" he asked. Then a brave Roman soldier named Horatius stepped forward. He spoke these words: ""Death comes to all men sooner or later. How can a man die better than facing terrible danger for his fathers' memory, for his gods' temples, and for his family? Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, as fast as you can. I will take two more men to help me. We will hold back the enemy. In that narrow path, three men can stop a thousand. Who will stand beside me and help keep the bridge?""
Two more brave men came forward to join Horatius. While the other Romans began chopping down the bridge with axes and hammers, these three warriors went out to face the entire Etruscan army by themselves.

---

The Etruscans laughed when they saw only three Romans blocking their way. They thought victory would be easy. First, they sent three of their best fighters into battle. The Romans threw one Etruscan off the bridge and killed the other two. Then the Etruscans sent three more warriors. Again, the Romans defeated them all. Finally, the Etruscans sent their bravest and strongest fighter. His name was Astur. He swung his sharp sword and wounded Horatius in the leg. Horatius fell back on one knee for just a moment. Then he jumped up and charged forward like a wild cat. He drove his sword right through Astur's helmet. The great Etruscan warrior fell to the ground with a terrible crash!
Just then, the bridge began to shake and fall apart. The two Romans helping Horatius ran back across the bridge to safety. Horatius tried to follow them, but the bridge collapsed before he could cross. Now he was alone, facing thousands of angry enemy soldiers!

---

Horatius prayed to the river god: ""Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber! Please save a Roman's life today!"" Then he jumped into the rushing river. His heavy armor made it very hard to swim. He almost drowned in the deep, fast-moving water. But he fought against the current and finally made it across the river to Rome. The people welcomed him as a great hero.

        In the early days of the Roman Republic, Rome was in great danger. The kings had been driven out, but they wanted to come back and rule again. King Tarquin's son, Sextus, went to an area north of Rome. He helped an Etruscan king build a huge army. Then the two of them marched toward Rome to attack the city. They led their army all the way to the Tiber River right outside Rome's walls.
The men of Rome held an important meeting. They knew there was only one way to save their city. They had to tear down the bridge over the Tiber River. If the Etruscan army crossed that bridge, Rome would be lost forever. But if the Romans could destroy the bridge, the enemy soldiers would not be able to cross the river and enter their city.

---

The consul spoke to all the people gathered there. ""Which of you will stand and fight the Etruscans while we tear down the bridge?"" he asked. Then a brave Roman soldier named Horatius stepped forward. He spoke these words: ""Death comes to all men sooner or later. How can a man die better than facing terrible danger for his fathers' memory, for his gods' temples, and for his family? Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, as fast as you can. I will take two more men to help me. We will hold back the enemy. In that narrow path, three men can stop a thousand. Who will stand beside me and help keep the bridge?""
Two more brave men came forward to join Horatius. While the other Romans began chopping down the bridge with axes and hammers, these three warriors went out to face the entire Etruscan army by themselves.

---

The Etruscans laughed when they saw only three Romans blocking their way. They thought victory would be easy. First, they sent three of their best fighters into battle. The Romans threw one Etruscan off the bridge and killed the other two. Then the Etruscans sent three more warriors. Again, the Romans defeated them all. Finally, the Etruscans sent their bravest and strongest fighter. His name was Astur. He swung his sharp sword and wounded Horatius in the leg. Horatius fell back on one knee for just a moment. Then he jumped up and charged forward like a wild cat. He drove his sword right through Astur's helmet. The great Etruscan warrior fell to the ground with a terrible crash!
Just then, the bridge began to shake and fall apart. The two Romans helping Horatius ran back across the bridge to safety. Horatius tried to follow them, but the bridge collapsed before he could cross. Now he was alone, facing thousands of angry enemy soldiers!

---

Horatius prayed to the river god: ""Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber! Please save a Roman's life today!"" Then he jumped into the rushing river. His heavy armor made it very hard to swim. He almost drowned in the deep, fast-moving water. But he fought against the current and finally made it across the river to Rome. The people welcomed him as a great hero.

The Etruscans laughed when they saw only three Romans blocking their way. They thought victory would be easy. First, they sent three of their best fighters into battle. The Romans threw one Etruscan off the bridge and killed the other two. Then the Etruscans sent three more warriors. Again, the Romans defeated them all. Finally, the Etruscans sent their bravest and strongest fighter. His name was Astur. He swung his sharp sword and wounded Horatius in the leg. Horatius fell back on one knee for just a moment. Then he jumped up and charged forward like a wild cat. He drove his sword right through Astur's helmet. The great Etruscan warrior fell to the ground with a terrible crash!
Just then, the bridge began to shake and fall apart. The two Romans helping Horatius ran back across the bridge to safety. Horatius tried to follow them, but the bridge collapsed before he could cross. Now he was alone, facing thousands of angry enemy soldiers!

Horatius prayed to the river god: ""Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber! Please save a Roman's life today!"" Then he jumped into the rushing river. His heavy armor made it very hard to swim. He almost drowned in the deep, fast-moving water. But he fought against the current and finally made it across the river to Rome. The people welcomed him as a great hero.
The grateful people of Rome gave Horatius a farm as a reward. They also built a statue of him and placed it where everyone could see it. The statue showed Horatius in his armor, kneeling on one knee. Words written in gold letters told how valiantly he had defended the bridge in those brave days long ago. His courage had saved Rome from its enemies.",,,,,"Based on the entire story, why did Romans tell this legend about Horatius for many generations?",MCQ,To remember the clever strategy of destroying bridges to stop enemy armies,To teach that one person's courage and sacrifice can protect an entire nation,To explain how Rome became powerful by defeating the Etruscan armies,To describe the weapons and fighting techniques used by ancient soldiers,B,"While bridge destruction is mentioned, the legend focuses on Horatius's personal courage, not military strategies.

It focuses narrowly on one bridge, one day, and one hero's actions. The legend teaches about personal courage and sacrifice, not historical explanations of Roman military success or power development.","While weapons are mentioned, the story doesn't provide detailed technical information about combat.

article_101055,What Is Light?,test_quiz,5,quiz_302445_sibling_1,quiz,,"What Is Light?
    
    
        Did you know that the sun is the greatest source of light for our planet, Earth? But what is light? Why is it so important? Hot gases of the sun give off both light and heat energy. Light carries energy, with the long waves carrying the least and the short waves carrying the most.
When you think of something with lots of energy, what comes to mind? Do you think of something fast like a race car? Do you think of something with great force like a very strong wind knocking down a tree? Believe it or not, light can be many times more powerful than a car or the wind.
Light travels at 186,000 miles every second in empty space. At that speed, light can go around Earth more than seven times every second! No human-made machine can go that fast—not even a jet plane or rocket!

One way that light travels, including light from the sun, is in the form of waves. Scientists can measure how long light waves are. Waves can be different sizes—some are long and some are short. Some light waves are visible and some are invisible. Whether you can see light or not depends on the length of the wave. The longest wave of visible light is seen as red and the shortest wave is violet. Short waves carry the most energy.
The sun gives off what is called white light. Perhaps you think of the light from the sun as having no color at all. Maybe you think the light from the sun is more yellow in color. It may surprise you to know that the sun's light, white light, is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. White light includes light of different wave lengths, including all the colors we can see.
Although the sun is the greatest source of visible light, there are also other sources of light. What else in the sky provides light? The other stars in the night sky provide light, though it is not as bright as the light from the sun during the day. The moon is not a star and does not give off its own light.

---

Can you think of other sources of light? Is there light in your classroom right now? Perhaps it is from the sun shining through the windows. Chances are good, though, that some of the light in the room may be coming from light bulbs. Like the sun, most light bulbs give off white light. Electric lights are such a part of our everyday life, we don't even think about them—unless the electricity goes off! This doesn't happen often, but sometimes it does during a bad storm. When the electricity goes off and we do not have light from light bulbs, people sometimes use other sources of light, like flashlights or candles.

        Did you know that the sun is the greatest source of light for our planet, Earth? But what is light? Why is it so important? Hot gases of the sun give off both light and heat energy. Light carries energy, with the long waves carrying the least and the short waves carrying the most.
When you think of something with lots of energy, what comes to mind? Do you think of something fast like a race car? Do you think of something with great force like a very strong wind knocking down a tree? Believe it or not, light can be many times more powerful than a car or the wind.
Light travels at 186,000 miles every second in empty space. At that speed, light can go around Earth more than seven times every second! No human-made machine can go that fast—not even a jet plane or rocket!

One way that light travels, including light from the sun, is in the form of waves. Scientists can measure how long light waves are. Waves can be different sizes—some are long and some are short. Some light waves are visible and some are invisible. Whether you can see light or not depends on the length of the wave. The longest wave of visible light is seen as red and the shortest wave is violet. Short waves carry the most energy.
The sun gives off what is called white light. Perhaps you think of the light from the sun as having no color at all. Maybe you think the light from the sun is more yellow in color. It may surprise you to know that the sun's light, white light, is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. White light includes light of different wave lengths, including all the colors we can see.
Although the sun is the greatest source of visible light, there are also other sources of light. What else in the sky provides light? The other stars in the night sky provide light, though it is not as bright as the light from the sun during the day. The moon is not a star and does not give off its own light.

---

Can you think of other sources of light? Is there light in your classroom right now? Perhaps it is from the sun shining through the windows. Chances are good, though, that some of the light in the room may be coming from light bulbs. Like the sun, most light bulbs give off white light. Electric lights are such a part of our everyday life, we don't even think about them—unless the electricity goes off! This doesn't happen often, but sometimes it does during a bad storm. When the electricity goes off and we do not have light from light bulbs, people sometimes use other sources of light, like flashlights or candles.

Light travels at 186,000 miles every second in empty space. At that speed, light can go around Earth more than seven times every second! No human-made machine can go that fast—not even a jet plane or rocket!

One way that light travels, including light from the sun, is in the form of waves. Scientists can measure how long light waves are. Waves can be different sizes—some are long and some are short. Some light waves are visible and some are invisible. Whether you can see light or not depends on the length of the wave. The longest wave of visible light is seen as red and the shortest wave is violet. Short waves carry the most energy.
The sun gives off what is called white light. Perhaps you think of the light from the sun as having no color at all. Maybe you think the light from the sun is more yellow in color. It may surprise you to know that the sun's light, white light, is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. White light includes light of different wave lengths, including all the colors we can see.
Although the sun is the greatest source of visible light, there are also other sources of light. What else in the sky provides light? The other stars in the night sky provide light, though it is not as bright as the light from the sun during the day. The moon is not a star and does not give off its own light.

---

Can you think of other sources of light? Is there light in your classroom right now? Perhaps it is from the sun shining through the windows. Chances are good, though, that some of the light in the room may be coming from light bulbs. Like the sun, most light bulbs give off white light. Electric lights are such a part of our everyday life, we don't even think about them—unless the electricity goes off! This doesn't happen often, but sometimes it does during a bad storm. When the electricity goes off and we do not have light from light bulbs, people sometimes use other sources of light, like flashlights or candles.

Light is important for many reasons. Light and heat energy from the sun warms Earth. Without the light and heat energy from the sun, Earth would be freezing cold. You also learned back in kindergarten that the sun's light is needed for plants to grow. Also, without light, there would be no colors.
Can you think of another reason that light is important? Try to imagine a world in which there is no light—no sun, no stars, no candles, and no light bulbs. What would be different?

The passage states 'the long waves carrying the least and the short waves carrying the most' energy.

This contradicts the passage's explanation that different wavelengths carry different amounts of energy. The passage clearly states long and short waves carry different energy levels.

        Did you know that the sun is the greatest source of light for our planet, Earth? But what is light? Why is it so important? Hot gases of the sun give off both light and heat energy. Light carries energy, with the long waves carrying the least and the short waves carrying the most.
When you think of something with lots of energy, what comes to mind? Do you think of something fast like a race car? Do you think of something with great force like a very strong wind knocking down a tree? Believe it or not, light can be many times more powerful than a car or the wind.
Light travels at 186,000 miles every second in empty space. At that speed, light can go around Earth more than seven times every second! No human-made machine can go that fast—not even a jet plane or rocket!

One way that light travels, including light from the sun, is in the form of waves. Scientists can measure how long light waves are. Waves can be different sizes—some are long and some are short. Some light waves are visible and some are invisible. Whether you can see light or not depends on the length of the wave. The longest wave of visible light is seen as red and the shortest wave is violet. Short waves carry the most energy.
The sun gives off what is called white light. Perhaps you think of the light from the sun as having no color at all. Maybe you think the light from the sun is more yellow in color. It may surprise you to know that the sun's light, white light, is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. White light includes light of different wave lengths, including all the colors we can see.
Although the sun is the greatest source of visible light, there are also other sources of light. What else in the sky provides light? The other stars in the night sky provide light, though it is not as bright as the light from the sun during the day. The moon is not a star and does not give off its own light.

---

Can you think of other sources of light? Is there light in your classroom right now? Perhaps it is from the sun shining through the windows. Chances are good, though, that some of the light in the room may be coming from light bulbs. Like the sun, most light bulbs give off white light. Electric lights are such a part of our everyday life, we don't even think about them—unless the electricity goes off! This doesn't happen often, but sometimes it does during a bad storm. When the electricity goes off and we do not have light from light bulbs, people sometimes use other sources of light, like flashlights or candles.

        Look at a bright light in your room. You can see light rays shooting out from it. Each ray of light travels in a straight line from its source. Light always moves this way - in straight lines like arrows flying through the air.
What happens when light hits something in its path? It depends on what material the light touches. Some materials are transparent. This means light can pass right through them. Air, water, and glass are all transparent. When light hits these materials, it goes through to the other side. It's like the object isn't even there!
Buildings have glass windows so sunlight can come inside from outdoors. Some buildings even have a glass skylight in the roof. You can look up through the skylight and see the blue sky and white clouds above you!

---

Light cannot travel through all materials. Some materials are opaque. When light hits something opaque, the light gets blocked and cannot pass through. Wood, cardboard, and even your body are all opaque materials. Light cannot go through them to the other side.
When light gets blocked by an opaque object, something special happens. A shadow is created! The shadow takes on the same shape as the object that blocked the light. Look around your classroom. Can you find transparent objects that let light pass through? Can you also find opaque objects? You will probably see many more opaque objects than transparent ones. Do you see any shadows they make?

---

The size of a shadow can change in interesting ways. When an object is close to a light source, it makes a big shadow. When you move the same object farther from the light, the shadow becomes smaller. The object stays the same size, but its shadow changes! What makes this happen is how far the object is from the light source.
You can try this with your own hand. Hold your hand close to a flashlight, and project the shadow onto a wall. See how big the shadow looks? Now move your hand farther away from the flashlight. Watch how the shadow gets smaller! You can project different sized shadows just by moving closer or farther from the light.

---

Here's a fun experiment you can do. Get a flashlight, white paper, tape, and a cardboard tree cutout. Tape the paper to a wall. Have a friend hold the flashlight in one spot. Hold the tree cutout in front of the light to project its shadow onto the paper. Have another friend trace the shadow and mark it ""1.""
Now try moving closer to the light and farther from the wall. Project the tree's shadow again and trace it. Mark this one ""2."" Then move even closer to the light and try once more. Mark this tracing ""3."" Compare all three tracings. Which shadow is biggest? Which is smallest? You'll discover that the closer you are to the light, the bigger the shadow becomes!

Light cannot travel through all materials. Some materials are opaque. When light hits something opaque, the light gets blocked and cannot pass through. Wood, cardboard, and even your body are all opaque materials. Light cannot go through them to the other side.
When light gets blocked by an opaque object, something special happens. A shadow is created! The shadow takes on the same shape as the object that blocked the light. Look around your classroom. Can you find transparent objects that let light pass through? Can you also find opaque objects? You will probably see many more opaque objects than transparent ones. Do you see any shadows they make?

---

The size of a shadow can change in interesting ways. When an object is close to a light source, it makes a big shadow. When you move the same object farther from the light, the shadow becomes smaller. The object stays the same size, but its shadow changes! What makes this happen is how far the object is from the light source.
You can try this with your own hand. Hold your hand close to a flashlight, and project the shadow onto a wall. See how big the shadow looks? Now move your hand farther away from the flashlight. Watch how the shadow gets smaller! You can project different sized shadows just by moving closer or farther from the light.

        Look at a bright light in your room. You can see light rays shooting out from it. Each ray of light travels in a straight line from its source. Light always moves this way - in straight lines like arrows flying through the air.
What happens when light hits something in its path? It depends on what material the light touches. Some materials are transparent. This means light can pass right through them. Air, water, and glass are all transparent. When light hits these materials, it goes through to the other side. It's like the object isn't even there!
Buildings have glass windows so sunlight can come inside from outdoors. Some buildings even have a glass skylight in the roof. You can look up through the skylight and see the blue sky and white clouds above you!

---

Light cannot travel through all materials. Some materials are opaque. When light hits something opaque, the light gets blocked and cannot pass through. Wood, cardboard, and even your body are all opaque materials. Light cannot go through them to the other side.
When light gets blocked by an opaque object, something special happens. A shadow is created! The shadow takes on the same shape as the object that blocked the light. Look around your classroom. Can you find transparent objects that let light pass through? Can you also find opaque objects? You will probably see many more opaque objects than transparent ones. Do you see any shadows they make?

---

The size of a shadow can change in interesting ways. When an object is close to a light source, it makes a big shadow. When you move the same object farther from the light, the shadow becomes smaller. The object stays the same size, but its shadow changes! What makes this happen is how far the object is from the light source.
You can try this with your own hand. Hold your hand close to a flashlight, and project the shadow onto a wall. See how big the shadow looks? Now move your hand farther away from the flashlight. Watch how the shadow gets smaller! You can project different sized shadows just by moving closer or farther from the light.

Mark this tracing ""3."" Compare all three tracings. Which shadow is biggest? Which is smallest? You'll discover that the closer you are to the light, the bigger the shadow becomes!

        You know that light travels in a straight line until it hits something. When light hits something you cannot see through, it makes a shadow. When light hits a mirror, it bounces back to your eyes.
But what happens when light goes through something clear? Light is very fast, but it does slow down when it passes through clear things. Light slows down when it goes through windows, water, and even air. The more dense something is, the slower light moves through it. Light moves slower through glass than through water. It moves slower through water than through air.

---

When light moves from one clear thing to another clear thing, it changes speed. When light changes speed, it appears to bend. This bending is called refract. You can see this happen with a simple test. Put a straw in a glass of water. Look at where the straw goes into the water. The straw looks like it bends! This happens because light slows down as it moves from air to water. The light changes direction and makes the straw look bent.
We use light that bends in many ways every day. Do you wear glasses? The clear pieces in glasses are called a lens. Each lens helps people see better by making light refract in special ways. These lenses can be made from glass or plastic.

---

There are two main types of lenses. A convex lens curves outward like the outside of a ball. This type of lens bends light rays closer together. When you look through a convex lens, things look bigger and closer. The lens makes things magnify, which means they look larger than they really are.
A concave lens curves inward like the inside of a bowl. This lens spreads light rays apart. When you look through a concave lens, things look smaller because the light waves are spread out.
A magnifying glass is a simple convex lens. When you hold it over something small, that thing looks much bigger. People use a magnifying glass to see tiny details better. Scientists also use convex lenses in microscopes to study very small things. They use them in telescopes to make stars and planets look bigger and closer.

---

Concave lenses are useful too. They spread out light rays to show a wider view of things. Security cameras use concave lenses so they can see more of a room or building at one time.
Many doors have peepholes so you can see who is outside. These peepholes often have two lenses. One is concave and one is convex. The concave lens lets you see a wide view outside your door.

        You know that light travels in a straight line until it hits something. When light hits something you cannot see through, it makes a shadow. When light hits a mirror, it bounces back to your eyes.
But what happens when light goes through something clear? Light is very fast, but it does slow down when it passes through clear things. Light slows down when it goes through windows, water, and even air. The more dense something is, the slower light moves through it. Light moves slower through glass than through water. It moves slower through water than through air.

When light moves from one clear thing to another clear thing, it changes speed. When light changes speed, it appears to bend. This bending is called refract. You can see this happen with a simple test. Put a straw in a glass of water. Look at where the straw goes into the water. The straw looks like it bends! This happens because light slows down as it moves from air to water. The light changes direction and makes the straw look bent.

There are two main types of lenses. A convex lens curves outward like the outside of a ball. This type of lens bends light rays closer together. When you look through a convex lens, things look bigger and closer. The lens makes things magnify, which means they look larger than they really are.
A concave lens curves inward like the inside of a bowl. This lens spreads light rays apart. When you look through a concave lens, things look smaller because the light waves are spread out.
A magnifying glass is a simple convex lens. When you hold it over something small, that thing looks much bigger. People use a magnifying glass to see tiny details better. Scientists also use convex lenses in microscopes to study very small things. They use them in telescopes to make stars and planets look bigger and closer.

        You know that light travels in a straight line until it hits something. When light hits something you cannot see through, it makes a shadow. When light hits a mirror, it bounces back to your eyes.
But what happens when light goes through something clear? Light is very fast, but it does slow down when it passes through clear things. Light slows down when it goes through windows, water, and even air. The more dense something is, the slower light moves through it. Light moves slower through glass than through water. It moves slower through water than through air.

---

When light moves from one clear thing to another clear thing, it changes speed. When light changes speed, it appears to bend. This bending is called refract. You can see this happen with a simple test. Put a straw in a glass of water. Look at where the straw goes into the water. The straw looks like it bends! This happens because light slows down as it moves from air to water. The light changes direction and makes the straw look bent.
We use light that bends in many ways every day. Do you wear glasses? The clear pieces in glasses are called a lens. Each lens helps people see better by making light refract in special ways. These lenses can be made from glass or plastic.

There are two main types of lenses. A convex lens curves outward like the outside of a ball. This type of lens bends light rays closer together. When you look through a convex lens, things look bigger and closer. The lens makes things magnify, which means they look larger than they really are.
A concave lens curves inward like the inside of a bowl. This lens spreads light rays apart. When you look through a concave lens, things look smaller because the light waves are spread out.
A magnifying glass is a simple convex lens. When you hold it over something small, that thing looks much bigger. People use a magnifying glass to see tiny details better. Scientists also use convex lenses in microscopes to study very small things. They use them in telescopes to make stars and planets look bigger and closer.

---

Concave lenses are useful too. They spread out light rays to show a wider view of things. Security cameras use concave lenses so they can see more of a room or building at one time.
Many doors have peepholes so you can see who is outside. These peepholes often have two lenses. One is concave and one is convex. The concave lens lets you see a wide view outside your door.

        Do you remember what color sunlight is? You might think it has no color, but that's not right! Sunlight is white light. White light is not ""no color"" at all. It is made up of all the colors you see in a rainbow. The sun looks yellow to us because it gives off more yellow light than other colors.
You can prove that white light has many colors inside it. You need a special piece of glass called a prism. A prism is shaped like a triangle and you can see through it. If you hold a prism near a sunny window, something amazing happens. The light shines through the glass and makes a rainbow of colors appear!

---

Do you remember learning about refraction? When light passes through something clear like glass, it slows down and changes direction. A prism has a special triangle shape that splits white light into all the rainbow colors. Have you ever seen a real rainbow in the sky after it rains? The raindrops in the air work just like a prism. They split the sunlight and create the beautiful rainbow you see.
When white light gets split apart, it creates something called a spectrum. The spectrum is all the colors lined up in order. The colors always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These are the colors that people can see with their eyes. Each color has a different wavelength. Red light has long wavelengths and violet light has short wavelengths. You can remember the color order with this silly name: ""Roy G. Biv."" Each letter stands for one color!

---

Did you know that objects get their colors from the light they bounce back? Different things absorb some colors of light but reflect others back to your eyes. Blue jeans look blue because they reflect blue light back to you. They absorb all the other colors. A red sweater looks red because it reflects red light and absorbs everything else.
White things look white because they reflect all the light colors back. Black things look black because they absorb all the light and don't reflect any back to your eyes. This is why black things can get very hot in the sun!

---

The colors we can see are just a small part of all the light that exists. There are many types of light that we cannot see with our eyes. Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths than violet light. We cannot see ultraviolet light, but it can give us sunburn. X-rays have even shorter wavelengths. Doctors use x-rays to take pictures of bones inside our bodies.
Infrared light has longer wavelengths than red light. We cannot see infrared light either, but we use it every day. When you use a remote control to change TV channels, it sends out infrared light signals to the television. The TV receives these invisible light signals and knows to change the channel.

        Do you remember what color sunlight is? You might think it has no color, but that's not right! Sunlight is white light. White light is not ""no color"" at all. It is made up of all the colors you see in a rainbow. The sun looks yellow to us because it gives off more yellow light than other colors.
You can prove that white light has many colors inside it. You need a special piece of glass called a prism. A prism is shaped like a triangle and you can see through it. If you hold a prism near a sunny window, something amazing happens. The light shines through the glass and makes a rainbow of colors appear!

---

Do you remember learning about refraction? When light passes through something clear like glass, it slows down and changes direction. A prism has a special triangle shape that splits white light into all the rainbow colors. Have you ever seen a real rainbow in the sky after it rains? The raindrops in the air work just like a prism. They split the sunlight and create the beautiful rainbow you see.
When white light gets split apart, it creates something called a spectrum. The spectrum is all the colors lined up in order. The colors always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These are the colors that people can see with their eyes. Each color has a different wavelength. Red light has long wavelengths and violet light has short wavelengths. You can remember the color order with this silly name: ""Roy G. Biv."" Each letter stands for one color!

Did you know that objects get their colors from the light they bounce back? Different things absorb some colors of light but reflect others back to your eyes. Blue jeans look blue because they reflect blue light back to you. They absorb all the other colors. A red sweater looks red because it reflects red light and absorbs everything else.
White things look white because they reflect all the light colors back. Black things look black because they absorb all the light and don't reflect any back to your eyes. This is why black things can get very hot in the sun!

The colors we can see are just a small part of all the light that exists. There are many types of light that we cannot see with our eyes. Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths than violet light. We cannot see ultraviolet light, but it can give us sunburn. X-rays have even shorter wavelengths. Doctors use x-rays to take pictures of bones inside our bodies.
Infrared light has longer wavelengths than red light. We cannot see infrared light either, but we use it every day.

        Do you remember what color sunlight is? You might think it has no color, but that's not right! Sunlight is white light. White light is not ""no color"" at all. It is made up of all the colors you see in a rainbow. The sun looks yellow to us because it gives off more yellow light than other colors.
You can prove that white light has many colors inside it. You need a special piece of glass called a prism. A prism is shaped like a triangle and you can see through it. If you hold a prism near a sunny window, something amazing happens. The light shines through the glass and makes a rainbow of colors appear!

---

Do you remember learning about refraction? When light passes through something clear like glass, it slows down and changes direction. A prism has a special triangle shape that splits white light into all the rainbow colors. Have you ever seen a real rainbow in the sky after it rains? The raindrops in the air work just like a prism. They split the sunlight and create the beautiful rainbow you see.
When white light gets split apart, it creates something called a spectrum. The spectrum is all the colors lined up in order. The colors always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These are the colors that people can see with their eyes. Each color has a different wavelength. Red light has long wavelengths and violet light has short wavelengths. You can remember the color order with this silly name: ""Roy G. Biv."" Each letter stands for one color!

---

Did you know that objects get their colors from the light they bounce back? Different things absorb some colors of light but reflect others back to your eyes. Blue jeans look blue because they reflect blue light back to you. They absorb all the other colors. A red sweater looks red because it reflects red light and absorbs everything else.
White things look white because they reflect all the light colors back. Black things look black because they absorb all the light and don't reflect any back to your eyes. This is why black things can get very hot in the sun!

---

The colors we can see are just a small part of all the light that exists. There are many types of light that we cannot see with our eyes. Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths than violet light. We cannot see ultraviolet light, but it can give us sunburn. X-rays have even shorter wavelengths. Doctors use x-rays to take pictures of bones inside our bodies.
Infrared light has longer wavelengths than red light. We cannot see infrared light either, but we use it every day. When you use a remote control to change TV channels, it sends out infrared light signals to the television. The TV receives these invisible light signals and knows to change the channel.

        Do you remember what color sunlight is? You might think it has no color, but that's not right! Sunlight is white light. White light is not ""no color"" at all. It is made up of all the colors you see in a rainbow. The sun looks yellow to us because it gives off more yellow light than other colors.
You can prove that white light has many colors inside it. You need a special piece of glass called a prism. A prism is shaped like a triangle and you can see through it. If you hold a prism near a sunny window, something amazing happens. The light shines through the glass and makes a rainbow of colors appear!

---

Do you remember learning about refraction? When light passes through something clear like glass, it slows down and changes direction. A prism has a special triangle shape that splits white light into all the rainbow colors. Have you ever seen a real rainbow in the sky after it rains? The raindrops in the air work just like a prism. They split the sunlight and create the beautiful rainbow you see.
When white light gets split apart, it creates something called a spectrum. The spectrum is all the colors lined up in order. The colors always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These are the colors that people can see with their eyes. Each color has a different wavelength. Red light has long wavelengths and violet light has short wavelengths. You can remember the color order with this silly name: ""Roy G. Biv."" Each letter stands for one color!

---

Did you know that objects get their colors from the light they bounce back? Different things absorb some colors of light but reflect others back to your eyes. Blue jeans look blue because they reflect blue light back to you. They absorb all the other colors. A red sweater looks red because it reflects red light and absorbs everything else.
White things look white because they reflect all the light colors back. Black things look black because they absorb all the light and don't reflect any back to your eyes. This is why black things can get very hot in the sun!

---

The colors we can see are just a small part of all the light that exists. There are many types of light that we cannot see with our eyes. Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths than violet light. We cannot see ultraviolet light, but it can give us sunburn. X-rays have even shorter wavelengths. Doctors use x-rays to take pictures of bones inside our bodies.
Infrared light has longer wavelengths than red light. We cannot see infrared light either, but we use it every day.

article_101060,What Is Sound?,test_quiz,5,quiz_302488_sibling_1,quiz,,"What Is Sound?
    
    
        An alarm clock rings. A dog barks. A voice calls, ""Time to get up!"" Every day is full of sounds we know well. But what exactly is sound? Sound happens when something moves back and forth very fast. This back and forth movement is called vibration.
Try this fun test. Close your lips and hum a song. While you hum, put your hand on your throat under your chin. Do you feel something buzzing? What you feel is your throat moving back and forth very fast. When you hum, parts inside your throat called vocal cords vibrate. This makes the air around them move back and forth too. That creates the sound you hear.
Sound is a form of energy, just like light. Sound also moves in waves, just like light does. Sound waves move out from anything that vibrates. These waves make the air move back and forth in a way we cannot see with our eyes.

---

Two things must happen to make any sound. First, something needs to vibrate and create sound waves. Then, something needs to carry those sound waves to your ears. Scientists call the thing that carries sound waves a medium. Air is the most common medium that carries sound to us.
You hear sounds more clearly when you are close to whatever is making the vibrations. The farther away the sound waves travel, the weaker they become. That is why you can hear a friend standing right next to you much better than if they are calling from across the street.
Sound can travel through many different kinds of medium. It moves through gases like air. It also moves through liquids like water. Sound even travels through solid things like wood, metal, and glass. Think about hearing sounds through a closed door or window. The sound travels through the solid medium of the door or glass to reach your ears.

---

Have you ever been underwater in a swimming pool when someone called your name? The voice probably sounded strange, but you could still hear it. This happens because sound travels through the liquid medium of the water. Water carries sound waves differently than air does.
There is one place where sound cannot travel at all. That place is outer space. Space is empty. It has no air, no water, and no other medium to carry sound waves. Scientists call this emptiness a vacuum. Since there is no medium in space, there is no sound there either.
Sound waves travel much slower than light waves. Sound moves at about 750 miles per hour. That seems fast, but light travels 186,000 miles every second! Here is proof that light is faster than sound. During a storm, you always see the lightning flash before you hear the thunder. The light reaches your eyes first, then the sound reaches your ears.

---

The type of medium changes how fast sound travels. Sound waves actually move fastest through solid things. In old cowboy movies, you might see someone put their ear on steel railroad tracks. They do this to hear if a train is coming. The sound travels faster through the steel than through the air.
Try this experiment at your desk. Tap your fingers on the desk and listen. Now put your ear right on the desk surface and tap again. Which way sounds louder? The sound is louder when your ear touches the desk. This is because the sound waves travel faster through the solid wood medium of your desk than through the air.

You hear sounds more clearly when you are close to whatever is making the vibrations. The farther away the sound waves travel, the weaker they become. That is why you can hear a friend standing right next to you much better than if they are calling from across the street.
Sound can travel through many different kinds of medium. It moves through gases like air. It also moves through liquids like water. Sound even travels through solid things like wood, metal, and glass. Think about hearing sounds through a closed door or window. The sound travels through the solid medium of the door or glass to reach your ears.

Have you ever been underwater in a swimming pool when someone called your name? The voice probably sounded strange, but you could still hear it. This happens because sound travels through the liquid medium of the water. Water carries sound waves differently than air does.
There is one place where sound cannot travel at all. That place is outer space. Space is empty. It has no air, no water, and no other medium to carry sound waves. Scientists call this emptiness a vacuum. Since there is no medium in space, there is no sound there either.
Sound waves travel much slower than light waves. Sound moves at about 750 miles per hour. That seems fast, but light travels 186,000 miles every second! Here is proof that light is faster than sound. During a storm, you always see the lightning flash before you hear the thunder. The light reaches your eyes first, then the sound reaches your ears.

The type of medium changes how fast sound travels. Sound waves actually move fastest through solid things. In old cowboy movies, you might see someone put their ear on steel railroad tracks. They do this to hear if a train is coming. The sound travels faster through the steel than through the air.

        An alarm clock rings. A dog barks. A voice calls, ""Time to get up!"" Every day is full of sounds we know well. But what exactly is sound? Sound happens when something moves back and forth very fast. This back and forth movement is called vibration.
Try this fun test. Close your lips and hum a song. While you hum, put your hand on your throat under your chin. Do you feel something buzzing? What you feel is your throat moving back and forth very fast. When you hum, parts inside your throat called vocal cords vibrate. This makes the air around them move back and forth too. That creates the sound you hear.
Sound is a form of energy, just like light. Sound also moves in waves, just like light does. Sound waves move out from anything that vibrates. These waves make the air move back and forth in a way we cannot see with our eyes.

Two things must happen to make any sound. First, something needs to vibrate and create sound waves. Then, something needs to carry those sound waves to your ears. Scientists call the thing that carries sound waves a medium. Air is the most common medium that carries sound to us.
You hear sounds more clearly when you are close to whatever is making the vibrations. The farther away the sound waves travel, the weaker they become. That is why you can hear a friend standing right next to you much better than if they are calling from across the street.
Sound can travel through many different kinds of medium. It moves through gases like air. It also moves through liquids like water. Sound even travels through solid things like wood, metal, and glass. Think about hearing sounds through a closed door or window. The sound travels through the solid medium of the door or glass to reach your ears.

---

Have you ever been underwater in a swimming pool when someone called your name? The voice probably sounded strange, but you could still hear it. This happens because sound travels through the liquid medium of the water. Water carries sound waves differently than air does.
There is one place where sound cannot travel at all. That place is outer space. Space is empty. It has no air, no water, and no other medium to carry sound waves. Scientists call this emptiness a vacuum. Since there is no medium in space, there is no sound there either.
Sound waves travel much slower than light waves. Sound moves at about 750 miles per hour. That seems fast, but light travels 186,000 miles every second! Here is proof that light is faster than sound. During a storm, you always see the lightning flash before you hear the thunder. The light reaches your eyes first, then the sound reaches your ears.

---

The type of medium changes how fast sound travels. Sound waves actually move fastest through solid things. In old cowboy movies, you might see someone put their ear on steel railroad tracks. They do this to hear if a train is coming. The sound travels faster through the steel than through the air.
Try this experiment at your desk. Tap your fingers on the desk and listen. Now put your ear right on the desk surface and tap again. Which way sounds louder?

        An alarm clock rings. A dog barks. A voice calls, ""Time to get up!"" Every day is full of sounds we know well. But what exactly is sound? Sound happens when something moves back and forth very fast. This back and forth movement is called vibration.
Try this fun test. Close your lips and hum a song. While you hum, put your hand on your throat under your chin. Do you feel something buzzing? What you feel is your throat moving back and forth very fast. When you hum, parts inside your throat called vocal cords vibrate. This makes the air around them move back and forth too. That creates the sound you hear.
Sound is a form of energy, just like light. Sound also moves in waves, just like light does. Sound waves move out from anything that vibrates. These waves make the air move back and forth in a way we cannot see with our eyes.

---

Two things must happen to make any sound. First, something needs to vibrate and create sound waves. Then, something needs to carry those sound waves to your ears. Scientists call the thing that carries sound waves a medium. Air is the most common medium that carries sound to us.
You hear sounds more clearly when you are close to whatever is making the vibrations. The farther away the sound waves travel, the weaker they become. That is why you can hear a friend standing right next to you much better than if they are calling from across the street.
Sound can travel through many different kinds of medium. It moves through gases like air. It also moves through liquids like water. Sound even travels through solid things like wood, metal, and glass. Think about hearing sounds through a closed door or window. The sound travels through the solid medium of the door or glass to reach your ears.

---

Have you ever been underwater in a swimming pool when someone called your name? The voice probably sounded strange, but you could still hear it. This happens because sound travels through the liquid medium of the water. Water carries sound waves differently than air does.
There is one place where sound cannot travel at all. That place is outer space. Space is empty. It has no air, no water, and no other medium to carry sound waves. Scientists call this emptiness a vacuum. Since there is no medium in space, there is no sound there either.
Sound waves travel much slower than light waves. Sound moves at about 750 miles per hour. That seems fast, but light travels 186,000 miles every second! Here is proof that light is faster than sound. During a storm, you always see the lightning flash before you hear the thunder. The light reaches your eyes first, then the sound reaches your ears.

---

The type of medium changes how fast sound travels. Sound waves actually move fastest through solid things. In old cowboy movies, you might see someone put their ear on steel railroad tracks. They do this to hear if a train is coming. The sound travels faster through the steel than through the air.
Try this experiment at your desk. Tap your fingers on the desk and listen. Now put your ear right on the desk surface and tap again. Which way sounds louder?

        Let's think about what you have learned about sound by comparing it to light. How is sound different from light? Sound must have something to travel through. It needs a solid, liquid, or gas to move. Light does not need anything to travel through. Light can travel through the empty space around stars and planets. Sound cannot do this. Light and sound also travel at different speeds. Light moves much faster than sound.
Light and sound are similar in important ways too. They are both forms of energy that travel in waves. When you learned about light, you discovered that light waves can be different lengths. Some waves are long and some are short. The length of a light wave makes it appear to be a certain color.

---

Do you wonder if sound waves are different from each other? Think about these two sounds. A baby is crying for its mother. An adult is yelling loudly. Both of these are sounds. The sound waves from each travel through air, so they are alike in that way. But a baby crying sounds very different than an adult yelling! The baby makes a high, screeching sound. When an adult yells, it is a low, deep sound. This difference in pitch, or how high or low a sound is, comes from different kinds of sound waves.
The answer has to do with the length of sound waves! First, we need to understand how vibrations affect sound waves. Faster vibrations make shorter sound waves. These create sounds with a higher pitch. The baby's screeching sound vibrates very quickly. This makes shorter sound waves, but more of them. Can you think of other sounds that have a high pitch?
Slower vibrations make longer waves. These create sounds with a lower pitch. A yelling voice makes longer waves, but fewer of them. So you hear a lower pitch. Can you think of sounds that have a low pitch? Try changing your voice. Can you speak in a high, squeaky voice? Can you speak in a low, deep voice?

---

Sound also changes in loudness. If you're listening to the radio and a favorite song comes on, you might say, ""Turn it up!"" When you turn up the volume, you are making the sound louder. A scientist would say that you are making the sound more intense. More intense sound waves carry more energy and make louder sounds.
How far away you can hear a sound depends on how intense it is. A quiet sound, like a whisper, doesn't travel very far. A really loud sound can travel for hundreds of miles. When fireworks go off, people can hear the sound from miles away.

        Let's think about what you have learned about sound by comparing it to light. How is sound different from light? Sound must have something to travel through. It needs a solid, liquid, or gas to move. Light does not need anything to travel through. Light can travel through the empty space around stars and planets. Sound cannot do this. Light and sound also travel at different speeds. Light moves much faster than sound.
Light and sound are similar in important ways too. They are both forms of energy that travel in waves. When you learned about light, you discovered that light waves can be different lengths. Some waves are long and some are short. The length of a light wave makes it appear to be a certain color.

Do you wonder if sound waves are different from each other? Think about these two sounds. A baby is crying for its mother. An adult is yelling loudly. Both of these are sounds. The sound waves from each travel through air, so they are alike in that way. But a baby crying sounds very different than an adult yelling! The baby makes a high, screeching sound. When an adult yells, it is a low, deep sound. This difference in pitch, or how high or low a sound is, comes from different kinds of sound waves.
The answer has to do with the length of sound waves! First, we need to understand how vibrations affect sound waves. Faster vibrations make shorter sound waves. These create sounds with a higher pitch. The baby's screeching sound vibrates very quickly. This makes shorter sound waves, but more of them. Can you think of other sounds that have a high pitch?
Slower vibrations make longer waves. These create sounds with a lower pitch. A yelling voice makes longer waves, but fewer of them. So you hear a lower pitch. Can you think of sounds that have a low pitch? Try changing your voice. Can you speak in a high, squeaky voice? Can you speak in a low, deep voice?

---

Sound also changes in loudness. If you're listening to the radio and a favorite song comes on, you might say, ""Turn it up!"" When you turn up the volume, you are making the sound louder. A scientist would say that you are making the sound more intense. More intense sound waves carry more energy and make louder sounds.
How far away you can hear a sound depends on how intense it is. A quiet sound, like a whisper, doesn't travel very far. A really loud sound can travel for hundreds of miles. When fireworks go off, people can hear the sound from miles away.

        Let's think about what you have learned about sound by comparing it to light. How is sound different from light? Sound must have something to travel through. It needs a solid, liquid, or gas to move. Light does not need anything to travel through. Light can travel through the empty space around stars and planets. Sound cannot do this. Light and sound also travel at different speeds. Light moves much faster than sound.
Light and sound are similar in important ways too. They are both forms of energy that travel in waves. When you learned about light, you discovered that light waves can be different lengths. Some waves are long and some are short. The length of a light wave makes it appear to be a certain color.

---

Do you wonder if sound waves are different from each other? Think about these two sounds. A baby is crying for its mother. An adult is yelling loudly. Both of these are sounds. The sound waves from each travel through air, so they are alike in that way. But a baby crying sounds very different than an adult yelling! The baby makes a high, screeching sound. When an adult yells, it is a low, deep sound. This difference in pitch, or how high or low a sound is, comes from different kinds of sound waves.
The answer has to do with the length of sound waves! First, we need to understand how vibrations affect sound waves. Faster vibrations make shorter sound waves. These create sounds with a higher pitch. The baby's screeching sound vibrates very quickly. This makes shorter sound waves, but more of them. Can you think of other sounds that have a high pitch?
Slower vibrations make longer waves. These create sounds with a lower pitch. A yelling voice makes longer waves, but fewer of them. So you hear a lower pitch. Can you think of sounds that have a low pitch? Try changing your voice. Can you speak in a high, squeaky voice? Can you speak in a low, deep voice?

---

Sound also changes in loudness. If you're listening to the radio and a favorite song comes on, you might say, ""Turn it up!"" When you turn up the volume, you are making the sound louder. A scientist would say that you are making the sound more intense. More intense sound waves carry more energy and make louder sounds.
How far away you can hear a sound depends on how intense it is. A quiet sound, like a whisper, doesn't travel very far. A really loud sound can travel for hundreds of miles. When fireworks go off, people can hear the sound from miles away.

Very loud sounds can damage your hearing. People who work around loud sounds all day often wear ear coverings or plugs. These protect their hearing from getting hurt. You should be careful too.

        Have you ever noticed how well you know your mother's voice? You can tell right away who it is when she calls your name. Each person has a special voice that is different from everyone else's. Your voice can make many different sounds. It can be high or low, loud or soft.
Do you know the voices of your friends and family? You probably do! But how does your body make all these different sounds? You already know that something needs to move back and forth to create sound waves. You also know that sound needs air to travel through. Here's how it works in your body.

---

Air moves in and out of your body all the time when you breathe. Inside your chest, your lung gets bigger to take in air. Then it gets smaller to push the air back out. The air travels through a long tube called the trachea. Some people call the trachea the ""windpipe."" At the top of your trachea is a special part called the larynx. The larynx is also called your ""voice box.""
Inside your larynx are two groups of muscles called vocal cords. When you breathe in, the vocal cords stay relaxed. This lets air move past them and into your lung. When you speak, you push air out of your lung and over the vocal cords in your larynx. The vocal cords shake back and forth to make sound waves. These waves travel up your throat and out of your mouth.

---

When you were a baby, you did not need to learn how to breathe. Your lung worked by itself, bringing air into your body and pushing it back out. You also did not need to learn how to use your vocal cords to make sounds. As a baby, you made lots of funny noises and sounds. Ask your parents about this!
You did need to learn how to change those sounds into words so you could talk. You did this by listening to people who talked to you when you were little. You practiced saying the same sounds and words over and over. You learned to speak whatever language your family spoke to you. If your family spoke English, you learned English. If they spoke Spanish, you learned Spanish. Some people learn to speak more than one language.

---

Your vocal cords grow as you get bigger. When you have shorter vocal cords, your voice sounds higher. This is why small children have higher voices than grown-ups. The sound of your voice depends on how big your vocal cords and larynx are.
How loud your voice sounds depends on how much air comes from your lung and out of your mouth. When more air is pushed through your trachea and out of your mouth, your voice will be louder. When less air comes out, your voice will be softer.",,,,,Why does the author ask questions throughout the passage like 'Do you know the voices of your friends and family?',MCQ,to confuse readers about the main topic,to connect with readers and involve them in the topic,to test if readers are paying attention,to show that the author doesn't know the answers,B,"Incorrect.

        Have you ever noticed how well you know your mother's voice? You can tell right away who it is when she calls your name. Each person has a special voice that is different from everyone else's. Your voice can make many different sounds. It can be high or low, loud or soft.
Do you know the voices of your friends and family? You probably do! But how does your body make all these different sounds? You already know that something needs to move back and forth to create sound waves. You also know that sound needs air to travel through. Here's how it works in your body.

---

Air moves in and out of your body all the time when you breathe. Inside your chest, your lung gets bigger to take in air. Then it gets smaller to push the air back out. The air travels through a long tube called the trachea. Some people call the trachea the ""windpipe."" At the top of your trachea is a special part called the larynx. The larynx is also called your ""voice box.""
Inside your larynx are two groups of muscles called vocal cords. When you breathe in, the vocal cords stay relaxed. This lets air move past them and into your lung. When you speak, you push air out of your lung and over the vocal cords in your larynx. The vocal cords shake back and forth to make sound waves. These waves travel up your throat and out of your mouth.

        Have you ever noticed how well you know your mother's voice? You can tell right away who it is when she calls your name. Each person has a special voice that is different from everyone else's. Your voice can make many different sounds. It can be high or low, loud or soft.
Do you know the voices of your friends and family? You probably do! But how does your body make all these different sounds? You already know that something needs to move back and forth to create sound waves. You also know that sound needs air to travel through. Here's how it works in your body.

---

Air moves in and out of your body all the time when you breathe. Inside your chest, your lung gets bigger to take in air. Then it gets smaller to push the air back out. The air travels through a long tube called the trachea. Some people call the trachea the ""windpipe."" At the top of your trachea is a special part called the larynx. The larynx is also called your ""voice box.""
Inside your larynx are two groups of muscles called vocal cords. When you breathe in, the vocal cords stay relaxed. This lets air move past them and into your lung. When you speak, you push air out of your lung and over the vocal cords in your larynx. The vocal cords shake back and forth to make sound waves. These waves travel up your throat and out of your mouth.

---

When you were a baby, you did not need to learn how to breathe. Your lung worked by itself, bringing air into your body and pushing it back out. You also did not need to learn how to use your vocal cords to make sounds. As a baby, you made lots of funny noises and sounds. Ask your parents about this!
You did need to learn how to change those sounds into words so you could talk. You did this by listening to people who talked to you when you were little. You practiced saying the same sounds and words over and over. You learned to speak whatever language your family spoke to you. If your family spoke English, you learned English. If they spoke Spanish, you learned Spanish. Some people learn to speak more than one language.

---

Your vocal cords grow as you get bigger. When you have shorter vocal cords, your voice sounds higher. This is why small children have higher voices than grown-ups. The sound of your voice depends on how big your vocal cords and larynx are.
How loud your voice sounds depends on how much air comes from your lung and out of your mouth. When more air is pushed through your trachea and out of your mouth, your voice will be louder. When less air comes out, your voice will be softer.",,,,,"Based on the passage, the author develops the main idea that each person's voice is unique by explaining which key details?",MCQ,The steps babies follow to learn different languages from their families.,The ways breathing works automatically without needing to learn it.,The physical factors like vocal cord size and air amount that affect voice quality.,The differences between the trachea and the larynx in your throat.,C,"Incorrect.

This confuses language learning with voice characteristics.","Incorrect. Automatic breathing is mentioned, but doesn't explain voice uniqueness.

        The word photography comes from two Greek words. Photo means ""light"" and graphein means ""to draw."" So photography means ""to draw with light.""
The first ideas for making pictures with light came long ago. A Greek man named Aristotle lived in the 4th century BC. He watched how light works and wrote notes about it. Around 1000 AD, an Arab scientist named Alhazen used Aristotle's ideas. He made the first pinhole camera. It was a box with a tiny hole in one side. Light came through the hole and made an image on the other side of the box. Alhazen used it to help him draw better. His camera could not take pictures like we do today. Other people kept working to make pinhole cameras better. Even now, some people like to make their own simple pinhole cameras.

---

The first real photograph was made in 1826. A French man named Joseph Niepce made it. He had to invent a new way to capture images. He created what he called heliographs. Helio means ""sun."" He used sunlight to make pictures. The sunlight mixed with coal and other natural chemicals on a glass plate. It took eight hours in the sun before the image appeared! Then the image would fade away.
Another French man named Louis Daguerre took Niepce's ideas and made them better. He could use light to make an image in less than thirty minutes. His pictures were called daguerreotypes. They were named after him. Daguerreotypes used special chemicals like silver and iodine. These chemicals changed when light hit them. The image formed on a metal plate. People around the world wanted these new pictures.

---

The late 1800s brought many new improvements to photography. Creative inventors kept working to make cameras better. An American named George Eastman made a big change in 1888. He invented flexible film that could roll up. This replaced the heavy glass plates that older cameras used.
The invention of film led to the box camera. It was a simple box with a lens. The camera had film that could take 100 photos. People could take pictures and send the whole camera back to Eastman's company. The company would print the photos and send both the pictures and camera back. If you look at your family's old photo albums, some of the oldest photos might have been taken with a box camera.

Color films were not invented until the late 1930s and early 1940s. By then, most families owned at least one camera. Photo albums became common in homes. Cameras got much better in the 1950s. Edwin Land invented instant photography. He sold his first camera in 1948. With his camera, you got a fully developed photograph just one minute after taking it! These cameras were popular because people did not have to wait for their photos.

They were named after him. Daguerreotypes used special chemicals like silver and iodine. These chemicals changed when light hit them. The image formed on a metal plate. People around the world wanted these new pictures.

The late 1800s brought many new improvements to photography. Creative inventors kept working to make cameras better. An American named George Eastman made a big change in 1888. He invented flexible film that could roll up. This replaced the heavy glass plates that older cameras used.
The invention of film led to the box camera. It was a simple box with a lens. The camera had film that could take 100 photos. People could take pictures and send the whole camera back to Eastman's company. The company would print the photos and send both the pictures and camera back. If you look at your family's old photo albums, some of the oldest photos might have been taken with a box camera.

Color films were not invented until the late 1930s and early 1940s. By then, most families owned at least one camera. Photo albums became common in homes. Cameras got much better in the 1950s. Edwin Land invented instant photography. He sold his first camera in 1948. With his camera, you got a fully developed photograph just one minute after taking it!

        The word photography comes from two Greek words. Photo means ""light"" and graphein means ""to draw."" So photography means ""to draw with light.""
The first ideas for making pictures with light came long ago. A Greek man named Aristotle lived in the 4th century BC. He watched how light works and wrote notes about it. Around 1000 AD, an Arab scientist named Alhazen used Aristotle's ideas. He made the first pinhole camera. It was a box with a tiny hole in one side. Light came through the hole and made an image on the other side of the box. Alhazen used it to help him draw better. His camera could not take pictures like we do today. Other people kept working to make pinhole cameras better. Even now, some people like to make their own simple pinhole cameras.

The first real photograph was made in 1826. A French man named Joseph Niepce made it. He had to invent a new way to capture images. He created what he called heliographs. Helio means ""sun."" He used sunlight to make pictures. The sunlight mixed with coal and other natural chemicals on a glass plate. It took eight hours in the sun before the image appeared! Then the image would fade away.

        The word photography comes from two Greek words. Photo means ""light"" and graphein means ""to draw."" So photography means ""to draw with light.""
The first ideas for making pictures with light came long ago. A Greek man named Aristotle lived in the 4th century BC. He watched how light works and wrote notes about it. Around 1000 AD, an Arab scientist named Alhazen used Aristotle's ideas. He made the first pinhole camera. It was a box with a tiny hole in one side. Light came through the hole and made an image on the other side of the box. Alhazen used it to help him draw better. His camera could not take pictures like we do today. Other people kept working to make pinhole cameras better. Even now, some people like to make their own simple pinhole cameras.

The first real photograph was made in 1826. A French man named Joseph Niepce made it. He had to invent a new way to capture images. He created what he called heliographs. Helio means ""sun."" He used sunlight to make pictures. The sunlight mixed with coal and other natural chemicals on a glass plate. It took eight hours in the sun before the image appeared! Then the image would fade away.
Another French man named Louis Daguerre took Niepce's ideas and made them better. He could use light to make an image in less than thirty minutes. His pictures were called daguerreotypes. They were named after him. Daguerreotypes used special chemicals like silver and iodine. These chemicals changed when light hit them. The image formed on a metal plate. People around the world wanted these new pictures.

The late 1800s brought many new improvements to photography. Creative inventors kept working to make cameras better. An American named George Eastman made a big change in 1888. He invented flexible film that could roll up. This replaced the heavy glass plates that older cameras used.
The invention of film led to the box camera. It was a simple box with a lens. The camera had film that could take 100 photos. People could take pictures and send the whole camera back to Eastman's company. The company would print the photos and send both the pictures and camera back. If you look at your family's old photo albums, some of the oldest photos might have been taken with a box camera.

With instant photography, 'you got a fully developed photograph just one minute after taking it!' The immediate gratification of seeing results right away, rather than sending cameras away for processing, was the key appeal that made this technology popular.","This answer is incorrect because taking one hundred pictures was a feature of the earlier box camera invented by Eastman, not Edwin Land's instant camera.

        The word photography comes from two Greek words. Photo means ""light"" and graphein means ""to draw."" So photography means ""to draw with light.""
The first ideas for making pictures with light came long ago. A Greek man named Aristotle lived in the 4th century BC. He watched how light works and wrote notes about it. Around 1000 AD, an Arab scientist named Alhazen used Aristotle's ideas. He made the first pinhole camera. It was a box with a tiny hole in one side. Light came through the hole and made an image on the other side of the box. Alhazen used it to help him draw better. His camera could not take pictures like we do today. Other people kept working to make pinhole cameras better. Even now, some people like to make their own simple pinhole cameras.

---

The first real photograph was made in 1826. A French man named Joseph Niepce made it. He had to invent a new way to capture images. He created what he called heliographs. Helio means ""sun."" He used sunlight to make pictures. The sunlight mixed with coal and other natural chemicals on a glass plate. It took eight hours in the sun before the image appeared! Then the image would fade away.
Another French man named Louis Daguerre took Niepce's ideas and made them better. He could use light to make an image in less than thirty minutes. His pictures were called daguerreotypes. They were named after him. Daguerreotypes used special chemicals like silver and iodine. These chemicals changed when light hit them. The image formed on a metal plate. People around the world wanted these new pictures.

---

The late 1800s brought many new improvements to photography. Creative inventors kept working to make cameras better. An American named George Eastman made a big change in 1888. He invented flexible film that could roll up. This replaced the heavy glass plates that older cameras used.
The invention of film led to the box camera. It was a simple box with a lens. The camera had film that could take 100 photos. People could take pictures and send the whole camera back to Eastman's company. The company would print the photos and send both the pictures and camera back. If you look at your family's old photo albums, some of the oldest photos might have been taken with a box camera.

---

Color films were not invented until the late 1930s and early 1940s. By then, most families owned at least one camera. Photo albums became common in homes. Cameras got much better in the 1950s. Edwin Land invented instant photography. He sold his first camera in 1948. With his camera, you got a fully developed photograph just one minute after taking it! These cameras were popular because people did not have to wait for their photos.

The date 1826 and Niepce's name are factual details about photography's beginning, but they offer no comparison or evidence about equipment becoming easier or more practical to use over time.","This answer is incorrect because the invention date of color film indicates technological advancement in image quality but does not specifically demonstrate convenience. While color photography was an improvement, the timing of its invention doesn't show that equipment became more practical, portable, or easier to use - it just shows when color capability was added.","This answer is correct because having digital cameras built into cell phones - devices people already carry everywhere - represents the ultimate convenience in photography equipment. This contrasts sharply with early cameras that were separate devices, some requiring heavy glass plates or being sent back to companies for processing. The integration into phones eliminates the need to carry separate equipment, demonstrating maximum convenience.","This answer is incorrect because Alhazen's pinhole camera represents early, primitive technology rather than evidence of increasing convenience.

        What makes someone famous? Who would you think of if someone asked you to name a famous person today? You might think of a famous athlete or maybe an actor or musician. You could also think of a president or other important leader. One of the most famous inventors of all time lived over 100 years ago. His name was Alexander Graham Bell.
Alexander Bell was born on March 3, 1847. He was the middle child of three sons. His parents were Alexander and Eliza Bell from Edinburgh, Scotland. His parents called him ""Aleck"" when he was a young boy. Aleck had a very happy childhood. He got to live in two different worlds. He spent time at his home in the city of Edinburgh during the week. On weekends, he got to go to the country.

---

More than anything else, Aleck loved to learn new things. At Milton Cottage near Edinburgh, young Aleck liked to explore nature. He collected many different plants and studied all kinds of animals. In school, Aleck's best subjects were science and music. His mother taught him music. Aleck's mother was almost completely deaf, so she played music mostly by feeling the sounds. To hear the music better, she would put a hearing trumpet to the strings of her instrument. The trumpet made the sound louder so she could hear it.
Aleck's father was a very important speech professor. He studied the sounds of the English language. This was similar to the phonics you use when you learn to read. He really wanted to help his wife, Eliza, and other deaf people. In 1864, he invented something called a ""sound alphabet."" He called it Visible Speech. He spent many years creating special marks and signs. Each symbol stood for a different sound that the human voice could make.

---

The symbols that he used looked like the way a person's mouth looked when making certain sounds. Visible Speech helped deaf people learn how to talk better. This way, they could talk and share ideas with other people. The example of both his mother and father was a great inspiration for Aleck. He became very interested in inventing things on his own. He especially wanted to invent things that would help other people.
Aleck and his brother actually built a ""speaking machine."" The machine used the voice box from a dead sheep. Part of the machine worked like a mouth and throat. It could even say the word ""mama."" As an adult, Aleck worked with deaf students. He later got a job as a professor at Boston University. Making new inventions was a very big part of Aleck's life.

        What makes someone famous? Who would you think of if someone asked you to name a famous person today? You might think of a famous athlete or maybe an actor or musician. You could also think of a president or other important leader. One of the most famous inventors of all time lived over 100 years ago. His name was Alexander Graham Bell.
Alexander Bell was born on March 3, 1847. He was the middle child of three sons. His parents were Alexander and Eliza Bell from Edinburgh, Scotland. His parents called him ""Aleck"" when he was a young boy. Aleck had a very happy childhood. He got to live in two different worlds. He spent time at his home in the city of Edinburgh during the week. On weekends, he got to go to the country.

---

More than anything else, Aleck loved to learn new things. At Milton Cottage near Edinburgh, young Aleck liked to explore nature. He collected many different plants and studied all kinds of animals. In school, Aleck's best subjects were science and music. His mother taught him music. Aleck's mother was almost completely deaf, so she played music mostly by feeling the sounds. To hear the music better, she would put a hearing trumpet to the strings of her instrument. The trumpet made the sound louder so she could hear it.
Aleck's father was a very important speech professor. He studied the sounds of the English language. This was similar to the phonics you use when you learn to read. He really wanted to help his wife, Eliza, and other deaf people. In 1864, he invented something called a ""sound alphabet."" He called it Visible Speech. He spent many years creating special marks and signs. Each symbol stood for a different sound that the human voice could make.

---

The symbols that he used looked like the way a person's mouth looked when making certain sounds. Visible Speech helped deaf people learn how to talk better. This way, they could talk and share ideas with other people. The example of both his mother and father was a great inspiration for Aleck. He became very interested in inventing things on his own. He especially wanted to invent things that would help other people.

        What makes someone famous? Who would you think of if someone asked you to name a famous person today? You might think of a famous athlete or maybe an actor or musician. You could also think of a president or other important leader. One of the most famous inventors of all time lived over 100 years ago. His name was Alexander Graham Bell.
Alexander Bell was born on March 3, 1847. He was the middle child of three sons. His parents were Alexander and Eliza Bell from Edinburgh, Scotland. His parents called him ""Aleck"" when he was a young boy. Aleck had a very happy childhood. He got to live in two different worlds. He spent time at his home in the city of Edinburgh during the week. On weekends, he got to go to the country.

---

More than anything else, Aleck loved to learn new things. At Milton Cottage near Edinburgh, young Aleck liked to explore nature. He collected many different plants and studied all kinds of animals. In school, Aleck's best subjects were science and music. His mother taught him music. Aleck's mother was almost completely deaf, so she played music mostly by feeling the sounds. To hear the music better, she would put a hearing trumpet to the strings of her instrument. The trumpet made the sound louder so she could hear it.
Aleck's father was a very important speech professor. He studied the sounds of the English language. This was similar to the phonics you use when you learn to read. He really wanted to help his wife, Eliza, and other deaf people. In 1864, he invented something called a ""sound alphabet."" He called it Visible Speech. He spent many years creating special marks and signs. Each symbol stood for a different sound that the human voice could make.

---

The symbols that he used looked like the way a person's mouth looked when making certain sounds. Visible Speech helped deaf people learn how to talk better. This way, they could talk and share ideas with other people. The example of both his mother and father was a great inspiration for Aleck. He became very interested in inventing things on his own.

        Aleck Bell loved thinking of new things to invent more than anything else in the world. He especially wanted to help other people. In 1837, another inventor named Samuel Morse created a machine called the telegraph. The telegraph was a way to send messages long distances across wires. It could only send dots and dashes and could not transmit human sounds. Aleck began to think about ways that he might make this invention better. ""I used to tell my friends that one day we should speak by telegraph,"" said Bell. He spent all his time working on this new goal. Many other inventors were working on the same idea. The race for a new invention was on.
With the invention of the telegraph by Samuel Morse, people could send messages long distances. A system of dots and dashes called Morse Code was used to tap out messages on the telegraph. Three dots, followed by three dashes, followed by three more dots stands for SOS. This is code for ""Help!"" People all over the country could now talk to each other in a new way.

---

Boston, Massachusetts became an important place for many inventors. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) made space in one of its labs for Aleck to do his experiments. His days were filled with teaching students. Then he would try over and over to make human sound travel across a wire. All of his energy was spent on this creative idea. He wrote that his idea of using electric current to carry a sound would likely make others think him ""crazy."" So he kept most of his ideas and experiments secret.
Aleck hired a young mechanic to help him. Thomas Watson knew how electricity worked. At first, their experiments failed more than they succeeded. But Aleck thought they were getting closer to success. ""I think the transmission of the human voice is much more nearly at hand than I thought,"" he said. On June 2, 1875, his dreams came true.

---

Like many inventions, an accident led to an important discovery. With the electricity turned off, Watson sent a message to Aleck that Aleck could hear. He heard tones, not just one single-pitched sound. He knew instantly it was a huge step forward! ""I have (by accident) made a discovery of the very greatest importance,"" wrote Bell. This accident changed everything they knew about sending sounds through wires.
Three days later, the first telephone message was recorded. Bell said, ""Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you."" To Bell's great joy, Watson had heard and understood what Bell had said! Fame and fortune came to Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson. They soon formed the Bell Telephone Company to make and sell their new invention. People everywhere wanted to buy this amazing new machine.

Bell continued to invent for the rest of his life. ""Self-education is a life-long affair,"" said Bell. ""There is no failed experiment,"" he said to convince people to keep going with their ideas.

Like many inventions, an accident led to an important discovery. With the electricity turned off, Watson sent a message to Aleck that Aleck could hear. He heard tones, not just one single-pitched sound. He knew instantly it was a huge step forward! ""I have (by accident) made a discovery of the very greatest importance,"" wrote Bell. This accident changed everything they knew about sending sounds through wires.
Three days later, the first telephone message was recorded. Bell said, ""Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you."" To Bell's great joy, Watson had heard and understood what Bell had said!

        Aleck Bell loved thinking of new things to invent more than anything else in the world. He especially wanted to help other people. In 1837, another inventor named Samuel Morse created a machine called the telegraph. The telegraph was a way to send messages long distances across wires. It could only send dots and dashes and could not transmit human sounds. Aleck began to think about ways that he might make this invention better. ""I used to tell my friends that one day we should speak by telegraph,"" said Bell. He spent all his time working on this new goal. Many other inventors were working on the same idea. The race for a new invention was on.
With the invention of the telegraph by Samuel Morse, people could send messages long distances. A system of dots and dashes called Morse Code was used to tap out messages on the telegraph. Three dots, followed by three dashes, followed by three more dots stands for SOS. This is code for ""Help!"" People all over the country could now talk to each other in a new way.

Boston, Massachusetts became an important place for many inventors. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) made space in one of its labs for Aleck to do his experiments. His days were filled with teaching students. Then he would try over and over to make human sound travel across a wire. All of his energy was spent on this creative idea. He wrote that his idea of using electric current to carry a sound would likely make others think him ""crazy."" So he kept most of his ideas and experiments secret.
Aleck hired a young mechanic to help him. Thomas Watson knew how electricity worked. At first, their experiments failed more than they succeeded. But Aleck thought they were getting closer to success. ""I think the transmission of the human voice is much more nearly at hand than I thought,"" he said. On June 2, 1875, his dreams came true.

It could only send dots and dashes and could not transmit human sounds. Aleck began to think about ways that he might make this invention better. ""I used to tell my friends that one day we should speak by telegraph,"" said Bell. He spent all his time working on this new goal. Many other inventors were working on the same idea. The race for a new invention was on.
With the invention of the telegraph by Samuel Morse, people could send messages long distances. A system of dots and dashes called Morse Code was used to tap out messages on the telegraph. Three dots, followed by three dashes, followed by three more dots stands for SOS. This is code for ""Help!"" People all over the country could now talk to each other in a new way.

---

Boston, Massachusetts became an important place for many inventors. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) made space in one of its labs for Aleck to do his experiments. His days were filled with teaching students. Then he would try over and over to make human sound travel across a wire. All of his energy was spent on this creative idea. He wrote that his idea of using electric current to carry a sound would likely make others think him ""crazy."" So he kept most of his ideas and experiments secret.
Aleck hired a young mechanic to help him. Thomas Watson knew how electricity worked. At first, their experiments failed more than they succeeded. But Aleck thought they were getting closer to success. ""I think the transmission of the human voice is much more nearly at hand than I thought,"" he said. On June 2, 1875, his dreams came true.

---

Like many inventions, an accident led to an important discovery. With the electricity turned off, Watson sent a message to Aleck that Aleck could hear. He heard tones, not just one single-pitched sound. He knew instantly it was a huge step forward! ""I have (by accident) made a discovery of the very greatest importance,"" wrote Bell. This accident changed everything they knew about sending sounds through wires.
Three days later, the first telephone message was recorded. Bell said, ""Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you."" To Bell's great joy, Watson had heard and understood what Bell had said! Fame and fortune came to Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson. They soon formed the Bell Telephone Company to make and sell their new invention. People everywhere wanted to buy this amazing new machine.

Bell continued to invent for the rest of his life. ""Self-education is a life-long affair,"" said Bell. ""There is no failed experiment,"" he said to convince people to keep going with their ideas.

        Odin was the father of all the Norse gods. He sat at his dinner table in the great hall. Two black birds called ravens sat next to him. Their names were Thought and Memory. These ravens were Odin's special helpers who flew around the world as spies. Every day, they left Asgard, the home of the gods, and flew everywhere to see what was happening. Every night, they came back to tell Odin the news.
On this day, the ravens did not have much to tell him. Everything was quiet on Earth. Odin gave the birds some bread crumbs to eat. He cut pieces of meat for two wolves that sat at his feet. But Odin did not eat any food himself. He never ate anything. Instead, he drank mead, a sweet drink made from honey, from a special cup. Then he pushed the cup away and looked around the room with his one good eye. He saw two Valkyries, the women who worked as his servants. He nodded to them, and they began to clean up the table.

Odin stood up to leave, but then he heard a loud crash of thunder. He heard goats making noise and the sound of wheels on the ground. He knew this could only mean one thing: his son Thor was coming in his cart pulled by goats. Sure enough, Thor, the mighty god of thunder, rushed into the room. His wife Sif walked behind him with her head covered by a veil. Thor looked very angry. The veins on his forehead stuck out. His eyes burned with anger.
""This is terrible!"" shouted Thor. ""Loki has done something very bad this time!""
""What is wrong?"" Odin asked.
""Her hair!"" Thor yelled. ""That scoundrel cut off all her hair!""
""Whose hair?"" Odin asked. As he said this, Sif let her veil fall down. Odin looked at Sif and could not believe his eyes. Her beautiful long, golden hair that every goddess loved was gone. Someone had cut it all off. Only short, ugly pieces were left.

---

""Look at me!"" cried Sif. ""I am hideous! I look so ugly! I will go live with the dwarves underground! Without my hair, I am as ugly as the ugliest dwarf!""
Odin looked upset. He turned to Thor and asked, ""Are you sure it was Loki who did this?"" But even as he asked, Odin knew the answer. It had to be Loki. It was always Loki. Whenever something went awry or got messed up, whenever bad things happened, it was always Loki who caused the trouble.
Odin felt bad about this. He was the one who had asked Loki to come live with the gods in Asgard. Loki was not really a god. He was a giant who could change how he looked. Loki had been causing problems ever since he arrived.

""Stay calm,"" said Odin. ""I will take care of Loki.""
Odin decided to call an assembly of all the gods. He told them all to come to a meeting. He also told Loki to come. When Loki arrived, he saw the angry look on Odin's face. He saw that Thor was very mad and was holding his hammer tight. Loki knew that lies would not help him this time. He would have to tell the truth about what he had done. He put his head down.

        Odin was the father of all the Norse gods. He sat at his dinner table in the great hall. Two black birds called ravens sat next to him. Their names were Thought and Memory. These ravens were Odin's special helpers who flew around the world as spies. Every day, they left Asgard, the home of the gods, and flew everywhere to see what was happening. Every night, they came back to tell Odin the news.
On this day, the ravens did not have much to tell him. Everything was quiet on Earth. Odin gave the birds some bread crumbs to eat. He cut pieces of meat for two wolves that sat at his feet. But Odin did not eat any food himself. He never ate anything. Instead, he drank mead, a sweet drink made from honey, from a special cup. Then he pushed the cup away and looked around the room with his one good eye. He saw two Valkyries, the women who worked as his servants. He nodded to them, and they began to clean up the table.

Odin stood up to leave, but then he heard a loud crash of thunder. He heard goats making noise and the sound of wheels on the ground. He knew this could only mean one thing: his son Thor was coming in his cart pulled by goats. Sure enough, Thor, the mighty god of thunder, rushed into the room. His wife Sif walked behind him with her head covered by a veil. Thor looked very angry. The veins on his forehead stuck out. His eyes burned with anger.
""This is terrible!"" shouted Thor. ""Loki has done something very bad this time!""
""What is wrong?"" Odin asked.
""Her hair!"" Thor yelled. ""That scoundrel cut off all her hair!""
""Whose hair?"" Odin asked. As he said this, Sif let her veil fall down. Odin looked at Sif and could not believe his eyes. Her beautiful long, golden hair that every goddess loved was gone. Someone had cut it all off. Only short, ugly pieces were left.

---

""Look at me!"" cried Sif. ""I am hideous! I look so ugly! I will go live with the dwarves underground! Without my hair, I am as ugly as the ugliest dwarf!""
Odin looked upset. He turned to Thor and asked, ""Are you sure it was Loki who did this?"" But even as he asked, Odin knew the answer. It had to be Loki. It was always Loki. Whenever something went awry or got messed up, whenever bad things happened, it was always Loki who caused the trouble.
Odin felt bad about this. He was the one who had asked Loki to come live with the gods in Asgard. Loki was not really a god. He was a giant who could change how he looked. Loki had been causing problems ever since he arrived.

Every night, they came back to tell Odin the news.
On this day, the ravens did not have much to tell him. Everything was quiet on Earth. Odin gave the birds some bread crumbs to eat. He cut pieces of meat for two wolves that sat at his feet. But Odin did not eat any food himself. He never ate anything. Instead, he drank mead, a sweet drink made from honey, from a special cup. Then he pushed the cup away and looked around the room with his one good eye. He saw two Valkyries, the women who worked as his servants. He nodded to them, and they began to clean up the table.

Odin stood up to leave, but then he heard a loud crash of thunder. He heard goats making noise and the sound of wheels on the ground. He knew this could only mean one thing: his son Thor was coming in his cart pulled by goats. Sure enough, Thor, the mighty god of thunder, rushed into the room. His wife Sif walked behind him with her head covered by a veil. Thor looked very angry. The veins on his forehead stuck out. His eyes burned with anger.
""This is terrible!"" shouted Thor. ""Loki has done something very bad this time!""
""What is wrong?"" Odin asked.
""Her hair!"" Thor yelled. ""That scoundrel cut off all her hair!""
""Whose hair?"" Odin asked. As he said this, Sif let her veil fall down. Odin looked at Sif and could not believe his eyes. Her beautiful long, golden hair that every goddess loved was gone. Someone had cut it all off. Only short, ugly pieces were left.

---

""Look at me!"" cried Sif. ""I am hideous! I look so ugly! I will go live with the dwarves underground! Without my hair, I am as ugly as the ugliest dwarf!""
Odin looked upset. He turned to Thor and asked, ""Are you sure it was Loki who did this?"" But even as he asked, Odin knew the answer. It had to be Loki. It was always Loki. Whenever something went awry or got messed up, whenever bad things happened, it was always Loki who caused the trouble.
Odin felt bad about this. He was the one who had asked Loki to come live with the gods in Asgard. Loki was not really a god. He was a giant who could change how he looked. Loki had been causing problems ever since he arrived.

Odin decided to call an assembly of all the gods. He told them all to come to a meeting. He also told Loki to come. When Loki arrived, he saw the angry look on Odin's face.

""Her hair!"" Thor yelled. ""That scoundrel cut off all her hair!""
""Whose hair?"" Odin asked. As he said this, Sif let her veil fall down. Odin looked at Sif and could not believe his eyes. Her beautiful long, golden hair that every goddess loved was gone. Someone had cut it all off. Only short, ugly pieces were left.

""Look at me!"" cried Sif. ""I am hideous! I look so ugly! I will go live with the dwarves underground! Without my hair, I am as ugly as the ugliest dwarf!""
Odin looked upset. He turned to Thor and asked, ""Are you sure it was Loki who did this?"" But even as he asked, Odin knew the answer. It had to be Loki. It was always Loki. Whenever something went awry or got messed up, whenever bad things happened, it was always Loki who caused the trouble.
Odin felt bad about this. He was the one who had asked Loki to come live with the gods in Asgard. Loki was not really a god. He was a giant who could change how he looked. Loki had been causing problems ever since he arrived.

""I will fight him!"" shouted Thor. ""I will—""
""Stay calm,"" said Odin. ""I will take care of Loki.""
Odin decided to call an assembly of all the gods. He told them all to come to a meeting. He also told Loki to come. When Loki arrived, he saw the angry look on Odin's face. He saw that Thor was very mad and was holding his hammer tight. Loki knew that lies would not help him this time. He would have to tell the truth about what he had done. He put his head down.
""You will give Sif back her hair!"" said Odin in a loud, strong voice. ""I do not know how you will do it, but you must do it. I command you to fix this!""
Loki nodded his head. He knew he had to obey Odin and find a way to help Sif.",,,,,What does the text reveal about why Loki decides to obey Odin's command at the assembly?,MCQ,He realizes that Odin and Thor will not accept lies or excuses,He wants to prove he is the most powerful god in Asgard,He feels genuine sadness and guilt about hurting Sif's feelings,He hopes to earn a reward for following Odin's instructions,A,Correct! The text states 'Loki knew that lies would not help him this time' when he saw 'the angry look on Odin's face' and 'Thor was very mad and was holding his hammer tight.' He obeys because he has no other option.,"Incorrect. The passage actually describes Loki putting 'his head down' submissively. Nothing suggests he's trying to prove power - instead, he's submitting to Odin's superior authority because he must obey.","Incorrect. While Loki obeys, the text doesn't mention genuine remorse or sadness. It states he obeys because 'lies would not help' and he 'knew he had to obey Odin' - this is strategic compliance, not emotional guilt.","Incorrect. There's no mention of rewards. The text shows Loki obeys because 'he knew he had to obey Odin' after seeing anger and Thor's hammer - he's avoiding punishment, not seeking reward.",3,medium,RL.3.3,3,quiz_302549,2026-01-11T02:16:54.661477,Targets paragraph 4 about Loki's reasoning for obedience using multiple textual clues - differs from reference which asks about general conflict resolution across all gods,,all choices are motivations for Loki's decision to obey,all explain internal reasoning with similar psychological depth,"A=12 words, B=11 words, C=10 words, D=9 words - balanced within 10%",each presents distinctly different motivations for compliance,only A is defensible based on explicit textual evidence about lies not helping,targets paragraph 4 about Loki's specific reasoning - completely different from reference about general conflict patterns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        Odin was the father of all the Norse gods. He sat at his dinner table in the great hall. Two black birds called ravens sat next to him. Their names were Thought and Memory. These ravens were Odin's special helpers who flew around the world as spies. Every day, they left Asgard, the home of the gods, and flew everywhere to see what was happening. Every night, they came back to tell Odin the news.
On this day, the ravens did not have much to tell him. Everything was quiet on Earth. Odin gave the birds some bread crumbs to eat. He cut pieces of meat for two wolves that sat at his feet. But Odin did not eat any food himself. He never ate anything. Instead, he drank mead, a sweet drink made from honey, from a special cup. Then he pushed the cup away and looked around the room with his one good eye. He saw two Valkyries, the women who worked as his servants. He nodded to them, and they began to clean up the table.

Odin stood up to leave, but then he heard a loud crash of thunder. He heard goats making noise and the sound of wheels on the ground. He knew this could only mean one thing: his son Thor was coming in his cart pulled by goats. Sure enough, Thor, the mighty god of thunder, rushed into the room. His wife Sif walked behind him with her head covered by a veil. Thor looked very angry. The veins on his forehead stuck out. His eyes burned with anger.
""This is terrible!"" shouted Thor. ""Loki has done something very bad this time!""
""What is wrong?"" Odin asked.
""Her hair!"" Thor yelled. ""That scoundrel cut off all her hair!""
