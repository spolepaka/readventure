# Playcademy × TSA: 2-Week Math Raiders Pilot Proposal

**Target:** Texas Sports Academy, Grades K-5  
**Duration:** 10 instructional days

---

## The Problem

Alpha School data: 60% of students use RocketMath 10min/day, yet only **30% achieve grade-level fluency**.

The pedagogy works (+3 CQPM/hour with proper usage). The problem is engagement - insufficient practice volume.

## The Proposal

Replace current math drilling with **Math Raiders** for 2 weeks. Gamified math drilling, progress tracking with mastery grids aligned to Alpha standards, multiplayer modes with leaderboard. Measure engagement and learning velocity via standardized MasteryTrack assessments.

**Hypothesis:** Gamified UI, mechanics, and multiplayer will drive higher practice volume → faster fluency development.

## Pilot Structure

### Timeline

| Day | Activity | Duration |
|-----|----------|----------|
| **Day 1** | Pre-assessment, then game introduction (if time) | 15-20 min |
| **Days 2-9** | Math Raiders practice | 15-20 min/day |
| **Day 10** | Post-assessment (MasteryTrack) | 10-15 min |

**Total:** ~2.5 hours per student (fits existing math drilling schedule)

Students complete MasteryTrack baseline assessment first (10-15 min). Remaining time used to introduce Math Raiders and play 1-2 practice raids.

## Standards Coverage

### CCSS Alignment

- **K.OA.5:** Fluently add/subtract within 5 (20 CQPM target)
- **1.OA.6:** Add/subtract within 20, fluent within 10 (30 CQPM target)
- **2.OA.2:** Know from memory all sums of two one-digit numbers (30 CQPM target)
- **3.OA.7:** Know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers (30 CQPM target)
- **Grades 4-5:** Extended fluency across all operations (35-40 CQPM targets)

### Assessment Method

**MasteryTrack Integration:**

- Standardized 2-minute timed tests per operation
- Pre/post comparison measures CQPM improvement
- Third-party validated, aligned to CCSS fluency standards

## Success Metrics

### Primary: Student Engagement (Practice Volume)

**Target:** 75%+ of students achieve 15+ min/day productive practice  
**Productive =** ≥2 CQPM + 80% accuracy  
**Tracking:** Each raid (~2 min) automatically recorded, data exported for pilot report  
**Benchmark:** Alpha's 60% at 10min/day → targeting 75%+ at 15min/day

### Secondary: Learning Velocity (CQPM Growth)

**Target:** +2-4 CQPM average improvement over 2 weeks as measured by MasteryTrack

**Benchmark:**

- Traditional programs: +1-2 CQPM/week = +2-4 over 2 weeks
- Minimum acceptable: +2 CQPM (matches traditional)
- Target: +3-4 CQPM (2-3x faster than traditional +1-2/week rate)

### Additional Metrics

- **Accuracy:** ≥85% of students maintain 75%+ accuracy
- **Satisfaction:** ≥70% rate experience positively (post-survey)

## The Question This Pilot Answers

> **Does gamification solve the engagement problem in math fluency practice?**

Not better pedagogy - better motivation. Same standards, more practice, faster results.

**Traditional:** Sound pedagogy + low engagement = poor outcomes  
**Math Raiders:** Same pedagogy + high engagement = strong outcomes

2 weeks. Standardized tests. Clear answer.
