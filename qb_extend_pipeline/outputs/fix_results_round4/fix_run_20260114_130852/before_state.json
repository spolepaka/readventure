This question asks students to compare and analyze motivations, which is more aligned with inference and analysis standards (like RI.3.8 or higher-level thinking skills) rather than demonstrating understanding through text and visual information.",
      "difficulty_assessment": "The question may be too difficult for a Grade 3 level due to a few factors: the complexity of the historical context, the abstract nature of comparing motivations (i.e., understanding different ideas about helping Rome), and vocabulary terms such as 'conspirators,' 'senate,' and 'dictator.' This might require cognitive skills that exceed typical Grade 3 capabilities, making it more appropriate for higher grade levels.",

This question asks about sequencing details, which is more aligned with informational text standards or RL.3.3 (describing how characters' actions contribute to events). It doesn't assess understanding of characters, setting, or plot through text and illustrations.",

Without specific details from the passage regarding the order of gift-giving, it can be confusing for students, as they need to rely on implied understanding rather than explicit textual evidence.",
      "difficulty_assessment": "The passage does not provide explicit information about the order in which Loki gave the gifts to the gods, making the question reliant on inference rather than recollection of details. The grade level (3rd grade) may not possess the abstract reasoning skills needed to infer the sequence without textual support, and the vocabulary level regarding norse mythology and abstract reasoning might be challenging for the age group."

It requires the reader to interpret the character perspectives based on the provided passage, which may be complicated for this grade level. The vocabulary includes terms like 'obstacles,' 'colonists,' and 'skills,' which might require additional contextual understanding. Additionally, integrating information about perspectives without explicit statements in the text may pose reasoning challenges for Grade 3 students.",
