While the author mentions milk and dairy contain calcium, the passage also states 'Exercise is also great for your bones,' showing milk isn't presented as the ONLY way to maintain bone health.

The author explains x-rays in simple, accessible language: 'X-rays help us see inside your body' and 'We can take pictures of the inside of your body.' This straightforward explanation suggests the author believes x-rays CAN be understood by general audiences, including children.

Emotional engagement is a primary purpose of narrative stories, which develop characters readers care about and situations that evoke feelings.

The sentence about holding weight actually shows bone STRENGTH, not weakness or breaking.

Setting broken bones is discussed later in paragraph 4 in the treatment section. The sentence about holding weight appears in paragraph 3's explanation of normal bone function and properties.

Some healthy foods don't have milk or cheese.", "D": "Nice thinking, but the story doesn't say dairy is more important than other things.

When authors use 'one way,' they're indicating this is a single example among multiple options, not an exclusive solution.", "B": "Correct! The phrase 'One way' logically implies there are other ways. This inference is confirmed when the passage immediately adds 'Exercise is also great for your bones,' explicitly providing a second method. When reading, pay attention to phrases like 'one way,' 'another,' 'also,' and 'in addition' - these signal multiple options or methods exist.

The sentence says dairy products are one way to help bones, but doesn't claim all healthy foods must contain dairy. Some healthy foods have dairy, others don't.

The picture shows the cells, but the author mentions not seeing inside to explain why the picture is helpful.", "D": "Not quite!

The author states 'Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture.' The word 'since' signals a cause-effect relationship - BECAUSE readers can't see inside, the author provides a picture as a solution.

When reading informational text with images, notice how authors explain why visuals are included to help readers understand concepts not visible in regular circumstances.", "B": "Incorrect. While bone hardness IS discussed in paragraph 2, mentioning that you can't see inside relates to providing the picture, not to explaining bone hardness. The hardness discussion ('The outside part of a bone is very hard') is separate from the visualization problem. The 'can't see inside' statement directly leads to the picture solution, not to hardness explanation.", "C": "Incorrect. The cell composition is what the PICTURE shows, not what the 'can't see inside' statement explains. The author's logic is: you can't see inside \u2192 so I'll show a picture \u2192 the picture shows bone marrow cells.
