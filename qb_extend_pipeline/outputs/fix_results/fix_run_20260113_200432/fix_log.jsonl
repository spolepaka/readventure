While Romulus did go on to build Rome, the story shows his anger caused him to lose his brother and feel deep regret, not that it made him stronger.", "option_C_explanation": "This is incorrect. The anger between the brothers was about the wall, but the anger itself didn't help build anything - it led to fighting and death.", "option_D_explanation": "This is incorrect. The story shows that Romulus became a leader despite his anger causing problems, not because anger was necessary for leadership.", "fix_reasoning": "This question directly addresses RL.3.2 by asking students to identify a clear moral/lesson from the story. It focuses on concrete story events (Romulus's anger, the fight, his regret) that third graders can understand, rather than abstract cultural analysis. There is only one correct answer supported by explicit text evidence, making it unambiguous and appropriate for grade 3 difficulty level.", "fix_strategy": "full_regeneration", "question_id": "quiz_302313_sibling_3", "original_question": "Why might the Romans have told this particular story about their city's beginning?"}}
