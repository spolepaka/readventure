        There once was a poor boy named Aladdin. His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

---

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.",,,,,"In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him ""richer than any king in the world.""What does this phrase mean?",MCQ,Aladdin will have more money than he can count,Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom,Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave,Aladdin will meet kings from other countries,A,You successfully made a good prediction by using clues about the magic lamp and treasure. The text supports this when it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the magician promises it “will make you richer than any king in the world.” Remember to look for repeated hints and strong words like “will” to predict what will happen next.,"You may have thought “richer than any king” means Aladdin becomes a king, or you used what you know from other versions, but the text says the lamp “would make any person very rich” and “It will make you richer than any king,” which is about money, not ruling. So the correct answer is that Aladdin will have more money than he can count. Strategy: Reread and underline clue words like “rich/richer,” and choose the answer that matches exactly what the passage says—not what you expect from outside the story.","You may have brought in outside ideas (gold coins), but the text never mentions coins—Aladdin finds “beautiful gems,” and the lamp is said to make a person “very rich,” even “richer than any king.” That means the best prediction is about how much wealth he will have, not a specific kind of money, so “Aladdin will have more money than he can count” fits the text. Next time, stick to the exact words and look for clue phrases about the main idea, like “very rich.”","You may have focused on the word “king” and guessed he’d meet kings, but the text never says Aladdin will meet any kings; it says the lamp “had amazing powers that would make any person very rich” and the treasure “will make you richer than any king in the world.” That evidence points to the correct answer: Aladdin will have more money than he can count. Strategy: reread for clue words and choose the option that matches what the passage actually says, not ideas it doesn’t mention.",2,medium,RL.3.4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,original,,,,

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks.

This shows the real lesson is to be careful about trusting strangers who make big promises. Next time, check that your answer matches what happens in the whole story, especially the results of the characters’ actions.","You successfully identified the lesson by noticing how a stranger’s big promises led to trouble. The text supports this when the man promises to help Aladdin “learn to become a merchant and earn good money” and says the treasure will make him “richer than any king in the world,” but then he traps Aladdin in the cave. Remember, when finding a story’s lesson, ask yourself, “What happens after a character makes a big promise?”","You may have focused on the detail that Aladdin’s mother works hard, but the story’s events point to a different lesson. Aladdin doesn’t become rich through hard work—the stranger pretends to be his uncle, promises to make him a merchant, then uses magic and traps Aladdin in the cave to get the lamp. This shows the real lesson: be careful about trusting strangers who make big promises. Strategy: Reread the whole passage and ask, “What warning does the story give?” so your answer matches the main message, not just one detail.","You might be thinking about what parents usually say about strangers, but in the story the mother doesn’t give advice—she believes the “uncle,” and he is really a magician. The man promises Aladdin he will “earn good money” and find a treasure “richer than any king,” then he tricks Aladdin and traps him, so the lesson is to be careful about trusting strangers who make big promises. Next time, reread and ask, “What lesson fits what actually happens in the whole story?”",3,hard,RL.3.2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,original,,,,

""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy.

""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all.

Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.""What do you wish for?"" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, ""Take me out of this cave!"" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.""What is your wish?"" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.

One day, Aladdin told his mother, ""I want to marry the Sultan's daughter."" His mother laughed. ""Have you lost your mind?"" she said. ""Your father was just a poor tailor!"" But Aladdin said, ""Remember those shiny gems from the cave? Take them as a gift to the Sultan.""Aladdin's mother went to see the Sultan. ""My lord,"" she said, ""my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter."" The Sultan laughed loudly. ""Your son and my daughter? That's silly!"" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought. ""I have never seen such beautiful gems!"" Then the Sultan said, ""Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.""

When Aladdin heard this, he rubbed his magic lamp. The genie appeared right away. Aladdin told the genie what the Sultan wanted. Almost instantly, the genie brought forty servants.

The text supports this with “he rubbed the ring on his finger… a genie appeared” and “she… started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared!” Remember to scan for cause-and-effect moments—when a character uses something and something big happens—to answer similar “which/what helped” questions.","You may have focused on the shiny treasure, but the text says the gems were “just pretty stones” and used as gifts—they never cause magic. When Aladdin rubs the ring “a genie appeared,” and when his mother rubs the lamp “a huge genie appeared,” so the magic items are the ring and the lamp, not the gems. Strategy: Reread for cause-and-effect clues (like “when he rubbed…, a genie appeared”) to choose the items that actually make things happen.","It looks like you focused on one event (his mother’s visit), but the text shows the ring and lamp are what make everything happen: the ring genie gets Aladdin out of the cave, and the lamp genie brings food, forty servants with bowls of gems, and even builds a palace—after this, the Sultan agrees. So the correct answer is the magic ring and lamp because they help Aladdin again and again, not just once. Strategy: ask yourself, “What helps the main character throughout the whole story, not just in one scene?”","You may have mixed up who helped Aladdin; the text says, “The magician had gone back to North Africa… he did not care about Aladdin anymore,” so he gave no help. Instead, rubbing the ring and later the lamp made genies appear who freed him and brought food, servants, and a palace—so the correct answer is the magic ring and lamp. Tip: Reread and underline the sentences that show who actually helps before choosing your answer.",3,medium,RL.3.2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,original,,,,

It shows Aladdin being kind and clever: he gives the Sultan gems and uses the lamp to send “forty servants… each carrying a bowl full of gems,” so “the Sultan agreed that Aladdin could marry his daughter.” That means the main idea is that kindness and cleverness can lead to happiness. Next time, check what the whole story is mostly about, not just one exciting detail.","You successfully identified the story’s message by noticing how Aladdin’s kindness and clever problem-solving lead to a happy ending. The text supports this when he “quickly said, ‘We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!’” and later uses the lamp to meet the Sultan’s challenge, after which “Aladdin was so happy!” and “They celebrated… all day and all night.” Remember to look at what the main character does to solve problems and how the story ends to figure out the theme in similar passages.","You may have thought the story teaches how to find magic lamps, but the text never gives steps; Aladdin meets the genies by accident when he rubs a ring while praying and when his mother cleans a dirty lamp. Instead, the story shows that kind, smart choices lead to good things—he says, “Please bring us something to eat,” meets the Sultan’s challenge with help, and it ends with a happy wedding and feast. Strategy: For main idea questions, ask if the passage is a how-to or a lesson, and check how the story ends.","You may have focused on the “long ago” setting, but the text doesn’t describe real life in the past—there are magical genies and no facts about daily life. Notice how Aladdin kindly asks for food for his mother and cleverly solves the Sultan’s demand with the genie’s help, which leads to a wedding and a palace; this shows the lesson that kindness and cleverness can lead to happiness.

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.""What do you wish for?"" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, ""Take me out of this cave!"" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

---

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.""What is your wish?"" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food. Aladdin and his mother ate until they were full. Later, they sold the silver plates and bought more food with the money.

One day, Aladdin told his mother, ""I want to marry the Sultan's daughter."" His mother laughed. ""Have you lost your mind?"" she said. ""Your father was just a poor tailor!""

The text shows this when the genie takes him out of the cave (“Take me out of this cave!”), brings “twelve gold plates full of delicious food,” and later “brought forty servants” and even built a palace. Next time, look for actions that repeat across paragraphs and ask, “What happens again and again?” to figure out what the passage is mostly about.","You may have focused on the first part, where the ring genie helps Aladdin escape the cave. But in the later parts, the lamp genie brings food, forty servants, and even builds a palace—those are not escapes, they are magic solutions to bigger problems. So the best answer is that each part shows Aladdin using magic to solve bigger and bigger problems. Next time, check that your choice fits the whole passage, not just the beginning.","You may have picked “friendship” because it sounds like a common lesson, but the story never shows Aladdin learning about friends. The text repeats that magic fixes his problems: the ring genie frees him from the cave, the lamp genie brings food, and the genie sends 40 servants and builds a palace. So the best answer is that each part shows Aladdin using magic to solve bigger problems. Strategy: When a question says “each part,” look for what happens again and again in the story.","It looks like you focused on the objects, but the story doesn’t show Aladdin finding new magic things each time—he already has the ring and the lamp. The text shows him using their genies to fix bigger problems: the ring genie gets him out of the cave, the lamp genie brings food, and later the lamp genie provides servants and a palace so he can marry the Sultan’s daughter.

The princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.""Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,"" the magician commanded.

Poor Aladdin walked far from the city. He felt very sad and worried. He walked beside a river and rubbed his hands together. He did not know what to do. Then he remembered his magic ring! He rubbed it, and the genie of the ring appeared.""What do you wish?"" asked the genie of the ring.""Please bring my palace and my wife home to me,"" Aladdin begged.""I am sorry,"" said the genie. ""I cannot do that. Only the genie of the lamp can move the palace.""""Then please take me to be with my wife,"" Aladdin said.Poof! Suddenly Aladdin was in Africa. His wife was so happy to see him! She told him about the man who traded lamps. When Aladdin heard this story, he knew the evil magician had tricked them. He knew the magician used the lamp to steal their palace. Aladdin and his wife made a plan to get the lamp back.

The next day, the princess cooked a wonderful dinner for the magician. Aladdin hid so the magician could not see him. The princess put poison in the magician's cup. When the magician drank from the cup, he fell down and died.Aladdin ran into the room and looked for the lamp. He found it hidden in the magician's sleeve. Aladdin rubbed the lamp, and the huge genie appeared.""What do you wish?"" the genie of the lamp asked in a loud voice.""Take this palace with everything inside it,"" Aladdin commanded. ""Carry it back to Persia and put it next to the Sultan's home.""""I hear and I obey,"" the genie replied. The palace lifted up into the air and flew away.The next morning, the Sultan woke up and looked out his window. He was so happy to see his daughter and her palace again!

The Sultan isn't jealous of Aladdin. The text shows the Sultan loves his daughter and accepts Aladdin. The Sultan only becomes angry later when the palace disappears, but he isn't the cause of the danger. The magician causes the problems.",This is correct! The passage clearly states: 'The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck' and says 'This must be magic from the lamp!' The magician then 'traveled back to Persia quickly' and created an elaborate disguise and plan to steal the lamp. The magician's jealousy and scheme directly cause all the danger and problems that follow.,This is incorrect. Aladdin doesn't lose the lamp while hunting. He leaves it safely at home. The problem is that the princess doesn't know it's valuable. The magician deliberately tricks her into trading it while Aladdin is away hunting. The lamp isn't accidentally lost - it's stolen through deception.,This is incorrect. The story doesn't say the princess tells people about the lamp or that word spreads.

        Aladdin was very happy with his new life. He thought everything was perfect. But danger was coming. The evil magician heard about Aladdin's good luck.""That lazy boy?"" the magician said. ""He married the Sultan's daughter? This must be magic from the lamp!""The magician traveled back to Persia quickly. He dressed like a poor man who sells things. He carried shiny new lamps in a basket. He walked by Aladdin's palace and shouted, ""New lamps for old lamps!""Aladdin was out hunting animals. His wife, the princess, heard the voice from the street. She thought about the old, ugly lamp they had at home.""I would like to trade that old lamp for a shiny new one,"" she thought.

The princess gave Aladdin's magic lamp to the magician. He gave her a new lamp that was not magic. The magician hurried away with the real lamp. Later that day, he rubbed the lamp. The powerful genie appeared in front of him.""Take Aladdin's palace and everything inside it,"" the magician commanded. ""Move it to my home in North Africa.""""I hear and I obey,"" said the genie of the lamp.The next morning, the Sultan looked out his window. His daughter's palace was completely gone! So was the princess. He was very angry and scared. He sent his soldiers to find Aladdin. They brought Aladdin to the Sultan.""Find my daughter right now!"" the Sultan shouted.

These details demonstrate that the lamp mistake created serious danger and distress for multiple characters - the princess, Aladdin, and the Sultan.","This is incorrect.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

---

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

Soon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, ""Who are you?"" Alice felt confused. ""I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today."" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important.

The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” and he “dropped his gloves and fan and ran away,” which shows he was acting worriedly. Remember to look at what a character says and does near the word to choose the best meaning next time.","You may have focused on the word “angry,” but in “Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” the anger belongs to the Duchess, not the Rabbit. The Rabbit says “Oh no!,” gets scared, drops his gloves and fan, and runs away—these are signs he is worried, so “worriedly” is correct. Next time, check which character the feeling belongs to and use action clues to match the emotion.","You may have chosen “silently” because another part says Alice and the Caterpillar stared without speaking, but here “The White Rabbit was talking to himself” and says, “Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!”, so he isn’t silent. Those words show he feels nervous, so “worriedly” is the correct answer. Next time, reread the exact lines about the character and use clue words in the dialogue (like “Oh no!”) to match the feeling.","You may have focused on the Rabbit moving quickly and thought that meant he was acting bravely, but look at “Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!” and “he got scared and ran away,” which show he is worried, not brave. The correct answer is worriedly because his words and actions show worry.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash!

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

You successfully identified a pattern and key details by noticing that Alice changes size whenever she eats or drinks. The text shows this when it says, “She was getting smaller and smaller” after the bottle, “Now I am growing bigger and bigger!” after the cake, and the Caterpillar explains, “One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter.” Remember to look for repeated events and cause-and-effect clues (like what happens after she eats or drinks) when answering similar questions.","You may have focused on the line “I can barely see my feet” and turned it into “losing shoes,” but the story never mentions shoes. Instead, it shows a pattern: she shrinks after drinking from the bottle, grows huge after eating the “EAT ME” cake, and later changes size again by eating mushroom pieces. So the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over after eating or drinking. Next time, reread for exact words and look for events that repeat to find the main idea.","You may have focused on the door mix-up and thought she was locked out of a house. But the story says she “was getting smaller,” the cake made her “growing bigger and bigger,” later she was “getting smaller again,” and the Caterpillar explains the mushroom can make her taller or shorter. This shows the main thing that keeps happening is her size changing after she eats or drinks, which is why the correct answer is that she grows and shrinks over and over. Tip: look for what happens again and again to find the best answer.","You may have thought the line “as she spoke” meant she turned invisible, but the text says she is “getting smaller and smaller” and later “growing bigger and bigger”—it never says she disappears. The correct answer is that Alice keeps shrinking and growing after she eats or drinks (bottle, cake, mushroom). Next time, reread for the exact words that tell what changes (smaller, bigger, grow, shrink) and make sure your answer matches those words.",3,hard,RL.3.5,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,original,,,,

But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

Soon Alice found a large blue Caterpillar sitting on top of a mushroom. The Caterpillar was smoking a long pipe. Alice stood on her toes and looked over the edge of the mushroom. The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for a long time without saying anything.Finally, the Caterpillar took the pipe out of his mouth and asked, ""Who are you?"" Alice felt confused. ""I do not really know, sir. I knew who I was this morning, but I have changed so many times today."" The Caterpillar did not seem to understand Alice's problem with changing sizes.Before the Caterpillar crawled away, he told Alice something important. ""One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter."" Alice broke off a piece from each side of the mushroom. She ate tiny bites until she was back to her normal size.",,,,,How does the author structure the story to show that Alice's size problems get more complicated over time?,MCQ,Each paragraph shows Alice finding a solution that creates a bigger problem than before.,Each paragraph shows Alice meeting a character who helps her solve her problems.,Each paragraph shows Alice learning a lesson that makes her smarter than before.,Each paragraph shows Alice visiting a place that is more dangerous than before.,A,"This is correct.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

---

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

---

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

---

In front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, ""Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!"" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. ""That was not there before,"" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down!

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

---

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

---

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

---

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

In front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, ""Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!"" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. ""That was not there before,"" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together.

        Alice kept walking through Wonderland until she found a strange cat sitting on a tree branch. This was the Cheshire Cat, and he had a huge grin on his face. Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

---

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat. ""Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!""Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly. First his tail vanished, then his body, and finally everything was gone except his grin. The smile stayed floating in the air for a while after the rest of him had disappeared.""How curious!"" Alice thought to herself. ""A grin without a cat! I have never seen anything like that before!""

---

Alice continued walking until she came to a house. In front of the house was a large table set up for tea time. The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sitting at the table having tea. Between them sat a sleepy Dormouse. Even though the table was very big, all three of them were crowded together at just one corner.""No room! No room!"" they shouted when they saw Alice coming toward them.""There is plenty of room!"" Alice said angrily. She sat down in a big chair at the end of the table.""Have some lemonade,"" the March Hare offered.Alice looked around the whole table carefully. ""I don't see any lemonade anywhere,"" she said.""There isn't any lemonade,"" the March Hare replied.""Then it was not very nice of you to offer it to me,"" Alice said with anger.""It was not very nice of you to sit down when nobody invited you,"" the March Hare shot back.

        Alice kept walking through Wonderland until she found a strange cat sitting on a tree branch. This was the Cheshire Cat, and he had a huge grin on his face. Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat. ""Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!""Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly. First his tail vanished, then his body, and finally everything was gone except his grin. The smile stayed floating in the air for a while after the rest of him had disappeared.""How curious!"" Alice thought to herself. ""A grin without a cat! I have never seen anything like that before!""

Alice continued walking until she came to a house. In front of the house was a large table set up for tea time. The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sitting at the table having tea. Between them sat a sleepy Dormouse. Even though the table was very big, all three of them were crowded together at just one corner.""No room! No room!"" they shouted when they saw Alice coming toward them.""There is plenty of room!"" Alice said angrily. She sat down in a big chair at the end of the table.""Have some lemonade,"" the March Hare offered.Alice looked around the whole table carefully. ""I don't see any lemonade anywhere,"" she said.""There isn't any lemonade,"" the March Hare replied.""Then it was not very nice of you to offer it to me,"" Alice said with anger.""It was not very nice of you to sit down when nobody invited you,"" the March Hare shot back.

The Mad Hatter stared at Alice for a long time. Finally, he asked, ""Why is a raven like a writing desk?""""A riddle!"" Alice thought excitedly. ""This should be fun to solve!""""I think I can figure that out,"" she said out loud.""Do you really think you know the answer?"" asked the March Hare.""Yes, I do,"" said Alice confidently.""Then you should say exactly what you mean,"" the March Hare continued.""I do say what I mean. At least, I mean what I say. That's the same thing,"" Alice replied.""Those are not the same thing at all!"" said the Mad Hatter. ""You might as well say that 'I see what I eat' means the same thing as 'I eat what I see!'""The sleepy Dormouse added, ""You might as well say that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same as 'I sleep when I breathe!'""The Mad Hatter turned back to Alice. ""Have you solved the riddle yet?""""No, I give up,"" Alice said. ""What is the answer?""""I have no idea,"" said the Mad Hatter.""Neither do I,"" said the March Hare.Alice thought to herself, ""This is the strangest tea party I have ever been to in my whole life!"" She listened as the Dormouse told a very odd story about three sisters who lived at the bottom of a well made of syrup. Alice asked many questions because the story was so confusing. Finally, she got frustrated and walked away. ""That really was the strangest tea party ever!"" Alice concluded to herself as she left.",,,,,What is one way the author shows that Wonderland is a strange place?,MCQ,The Cheshire Cat disappears until only his grin is left.,Alice is welcomed and invited to sit at the tea table.,The March Hare pours lemonade for Alice to drink.,The Mad Hatter gives the answer to his riddle right away.,A,"Great job! You identified a key detail by noticing exactly what happened to the Cheshire Cat. The text says, “The Cat began to disappear slowly… finally everything was gone except his grin,” which matches your answer. Remember, when a question asks what happened, reread the sentences with signal words like “Then” or “Finally” to find the exact detail.","It looks like you mixed up events and thought Alice was welcomed, but the text says they shouted, “No room! No room!” and “nobody invited you,” so she wasn’t invited. In the part just before the tea scene, “the Cat began to disappear… finally everything was gone except his grin,” which matches the correct answer. Next time, reread the exact paragraph the question is asking about and match your choice to the words in that part of the text.","You might have thought that because the March Hare offered lemonade, he poured it, but the text says Alice looked around and said, 'I don't see any lemonade,' and the March Hare answered, 'There isn't any lemonade,' so no pouring happened. The correct detail is that the Cheshire Cat disappeared until only his grin was left. Next time, reread the lines after the part you pick to make sure the story really says it happens.","You may have mixed up the tea-party scene, thinking the Hatter answered his riddle, but the text says, “I have no idea,” said the Mad Hatter—so he never gives an answer. The passage does say the Cheshire Cat “vanished… until only his grin was left,” which is why that choice is correct.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

---

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too!

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

---

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

---

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

---

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

        ""Will you take me to visit Toad?"" Mole asked his friend Rat. ""I have heard so many things about him.""""Of course I will,"" said Rat. ""Let's get the boat and paddle up there right now. It's always a good time to visit Toad. Early in the morning or late at night, he's always the same friendly fellow. He's always happy to see you, and he's always sad when you have to leave!""""He must be a very nice animal,"" said Mole as he climbed into the boat.""He really is the best of animals,"" Rat replied. ""He is so simple and so friendly. Maybe he's not very smart—we can't all be clever. He might be someone who brags a lot and thinks too highly of himself. But Toady is a great friend.""

They paddled around a bend in the river. Soon they could see a beautiful, grand old house. It was made of faded red brick. Well-kept green lawns stretched all the way down to the water's edge.""There's Toad Hall,"" said Rat. ""Do you see that small creek on the left side? That goes to Toad's boathouse. That's where we'll leave our boat. The stables are over there. That big building you're looking at now is the banquet hall—it's very old. Toad has lots of money, you know. This is really one of the nicest houses around here. But we never tell Toad that!""They paddled up the creek and moved into the shadow of a large boathouse. Inside, they saw many big boats. Some boats hung from wooden beams above them. Other boats were pulled up on ramps. But none of the boats were in the water. The whole place seemed empty and quiet.

        Toad was very excited when Rat and Mole came to visit him. ""You must help me with something very important!""

Toad walked quickly to the stable yard. Rat followed him, but he did not look happy. There in the yard was a brand new travel wagon. It was painted bright yellow and green colors.""Look at this beautiful wagon!"" cried Toad. ""This is real life! We can travel on the open road! We can see dusty highways and visit camps, villages, towns, and cities! Today we are here, but tomorrow we can go somewhere else! We can travel to new places and have fun! The whole world is waiting for us! Come look inside. I planned everything myself!""Mole was very excited. He followed Toad up the steps into the wagon. But Rat stayed outside. He made an angry sound and put his hands in his pockets.

Inside the wagon were small beds and a table that could fold against the wall. There was a cooking stove, storage boxes, and bookshelves. Toad even had a birdcage with a bird inside. The wagon had pots, pans, and kettles of every size.""Everything is ready!"" said Toad happily. ""We have everything we need to start our trip this afternoon.""""Wait a minute,"" said Rat. ""Did you say 'WE' and 'STARTING' and 'THIS AFTERNOON'?""""Yes! You have to come with me!"" begged Toad. ""I can't go without you. Please don't argue with me.

        Lunch was wonderful at Toad Hall. The food was always good there. During the meal, Toad talked to Mole about taking a trip. Toad was very good at talking people into things. He told Mole all about the fun they would have on the open road. He made it sound like the best thing in the world. Mole got so excited that he could hardly sit still in his chair. In the end, Rat let Toad and Mole change his mind. He did not want to disappoint his friends. So after lunch, they loaded up the wagon and set off on their adventure.

        Lunch was wonderful at Toad Hall. The food was always good there. During the meal, Toad talked to Mole about taking a trip. Toad was very good at talking people into things. He told Mole all about the fun they would have on the open road. He made it sound like the best thing in the world. Mole got so excited that he could hardly sit still in his chair. In the end, Rat let Toad and Mole change his mind. He did not want to disappoint his friends. So after lunch, they loaded up the wagon and set off on their adventure.

""This is the real life for a gentleman!"" They had a pleasant trip along the narrow country roads. Everything was going well until they reached the big highway. That is where disaster struck them.

They were walking along the highway when they saw a small cloud of dust. It was coming toward them very fast. From the dust cloud, they heard a faint ""toot-toot!"" It sounded like an animal in pain. They turned to keep talking to each other. But in just one moment, everything changed completely. With a big blast of wind and a whirl of loud sound, it was right on top of them!

In the end, Rat let Toad and Mole change his mind. He did not want to disappoint his friends. So after lunch, they loaded up the wagon and set off on their adventure.

It was a beautiful golden afternoon. The dust from the road smelled rich and good. Birds sang to them from the thick fruit trees on both sides of the road. Other travelers called out ""Good day!"" to them. Some people stopped to say nice things about their beautiful wagon.""Ah,"" said Toad, stretching out his legs. ""This is the real life for a gentleman!"" They had a pleasant trip along the narrow country roads. Everything was going well until they reached the big highway. That is where disaster struck them.

They were walking along the highway when they saw a small cloud of dust. It was coming toward them very fast. From the dust cloud, they heard a faint ""toot-toot!"" It sounded like an animal in pain. They turned to keep talking to each other. But in just one moment, everything changed completely. With a big blast of wind and a whirl of loud sound, it was right on top of them! They had to jump into the nearest ditch to get out of the way.

The horn of the motor car rang out loudly, ""TOOT-TOOT!"" They got a quick look inside the car. It had shiny glass and beautiful leather seats. Then the amazing motor car threw a huge cloud of dust that made it hard for them to see. The car got smaller and smaller as it drove away into the distance.The old grey horse got scared and jumped forward. Then there was a terrible crash. Their beautiful yellow wagon fell over on its side in the ditch. Rat was very angry. He danced up and down in the road. ""You bad people!"" he shouted, shaking both fists in the air.

Toad's statement comes during the calm, pleasant portion of the trip before the motor car appears. The text describes birds singing, other travelers being friendly, and 'a pleasant trip,' not anything scary. Fear comes later when the motor car suddenly appears, but Toad's relaxed stretching and positive words show he feels safe and content at this moment.","This is incorrect.
