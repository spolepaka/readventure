This contrasts sharply with early cameras that were separate devices, some requiring heavy glass plates or being sent back to companies for processing. The integration into phones eliminates the need to carry separate equipment, demonstrating maximum convenience.", "D": "This answer is incorrect because Alhazen's pinhole camera represents early, primitive technology rather than evidence of increasing convenience.

This explicitly shows an inventor identifying a limitation (heavy, breakable glass plates) and creating a solution (flexible, rollable film). The word 'replace' makes clear that Eastman was directly responding to and improving upon earlier technology's shortcomings, making cameras more portable and practical.", "C": "This answer is incorrect because widespread camera ownership indicates adoption and popularity but does not demonstrate inventors responding to technological limitations.

The structure separates these movements by their different effects, not by suggesting they produce the same results."}}
{"question_id": "quiz_302614_sibling_3", "success": true, "rewritten": {"A": "Good try! The sun giving energy helps plants grow, but that doesn't explain seasons. The story talks about how Earth tilts to make seasons happen.", "B": "Great job! The story says Earth \"rotates on its axis\" first, then explains how it tilts. You need to know about the axis to understand seasons!", "C": "Not quite! What people believed long ago doesn't connect to seasons. The story explains seasons happen because Earth tilts, not because of old ideas.", "D": "Nice thinking, but the sun being hot doesn't explain seasons. The story says seasons happen because of how Earth tilts, not how hot the sun is."}, "original": {"A": "Incorrect. While the sun's energy is essential for life (Section 1), this doesn't connect to Section 4's explanation of seasons. Seasons are about how Earth's tilt affects where sunlight hits, not about the sun producing energy in the first place.", "B": "Correct! Section 4 begins by stating 'When Earth rotates on its axis, it is tilted' - directly connecting to Section 3's introduction of the axis concept. The axis must first be understood (from Section 3) before readers can grasp that Earth is tilted on that axis, which creates seasons.", "C": "Incorrect. The historical belief from Section 2 is about whether Earth or the sun moves around the other. This doesn't connect to Section 4's explanation of seasons, which is about Earth's tilt, not about historical misconceptions.", "D": "Incorrect. The sun's temperature and composition (from Section 1) explain how it produces energy but don't connect to why seasons occur. Section 4's explanation focuses on Earth's orientation and tilt, not the sun's properties."}}
{"question_id": "quiz_302614_sibling_4", "success": true, "rewritten": {"A": "You got it! The story says \"the sun rose in the east\" and \"set in the west.\" People thought the sun was moving because that's what they saw every day.", "B": "Good try! The story doesn't talk about measuring temperature when explaining why people were wrong. It's about what people saw the sun doing each day.", "C": "Not quite! The story doesn't say people thought Earth was the only planet. It explains that people were confused about what moves around what.", "D": "Nice thinking, but the story doesn't mention what the sun is made of in this part. It's about people watching the sun rise and set every day."}, "original": {"A": "Correct! Section 2 explains: 'Each morning, the sun rose in the east. At the end of the day, the sun set in the west. To explain this change, people said the sun moved around Earth.' People reasoned from what they observed - the sun's apparent motion - without realizing Earth's rotation creates this appearance. Their senses led to the wrong conclusion about relative motion.", "B": "Incorrect. Temperature measurement isn't mentioned in Section 2's discussion of the historical belief, and the sun's temperature doesn't relate to whether Earth or the sun moves around the other. The misconception was about relative motion, not temperature.", "C": "Incorrect. Section 2 doesn't suggest people believed Earth was the only planet. The issue was about what moved around what - whether the sun circled Earth or Earth circled the sun - not about how many planets existed.", "D": "Incorrect. The sun's composition (gases versus rock) isn't mentioned in Section 2's explanation of the historical belief. The misconception was about the motion they observed (rising and setting), not about what the sun was made of."}}
