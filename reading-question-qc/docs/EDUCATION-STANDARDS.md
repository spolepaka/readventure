## Common Core State Standards (CCSS)

### Overview

The Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts define what students should know and be able to do at each grade level in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language.

### Reading Standards Structure

The system supports two main reading domains:

| Code | Domain | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| **RL** | Reading Literature | Fiction, poetry, drama |
| **RI** | Reading Informational | Nonfiction, technical texts |

### Standard Code Format

```
RL.3.1
│  │ └── Skill number (1-9)
│  └──── Grade level
└─────── Domain (RL or RI)
```

### Key Reading Skills by Standard Number

| # | Skill Area | RL Focus | RI Focus |
|---|------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Key Ideas & Details | Ask/answer questions | Ask/answer questions |
| 2 | Key Ideas & Details | Central message/theme | Main idea |
| 3 | Key Ideas & Details | Character, setting, events | Connections between ideas |
| 4 | Craft & Structure | Word meaning | Word meaning |
| 5 | Craft & Structure | Text structure | Text features |
| 6 | Craft & Structure | Point of view | Author's purpose |
| 7 | Integration | Illustrations | Information from images |
| 8 | Integration | (varies) | Arguments & evidence |
| 9 | Integration | Compare texts | Compare texts |

## Depth of Knowledge (DOK)

### Webb's DOK Framework

Developed by Norman Webb, DOK measures the cognitive complexity of tasks, not difficulty.

### DOK Levels

#### DOK 1: Recall & Reproduction

**Cognitive Demand**: Basic recall of facts, definitions, or procedures

**Question Characteristics**:
- Directly stated information
- One-step process
- No inference required
- Single correct answer obvious

**Example Verbs**: identify, recognize, list, name, locate, recall

**Example Questions**:
- "What happens first in the story?"
- "Where does the story take place?"
- "What word means the same as 'happy'?"

---

#### DOK 2: Skills & Concepts

**Cognitive Demand**: Apply skills, make basic inferences, classify, compare

**Question Characteristics**:
- Requires mental processing beyond recall
- Multiple steps
- Basic inference from text
- Connects two or more concepts

**Example Verbs**: classify, compare, contrast, infer, explain, summarize

**Example Questions**:
- "How does the character change from the beginning to end?"
- "What can you infer about the author's purpose?"
- "Compare the two characters' reactions."

---

#### DOK 3: Strategic Thinking

**Cognitive Demand**: Analyze, evaluate, synthesize, draw conclusions

**Question Characteristics**:
- Complex, abstract reasoning
- Multiple text elements
- Evidence-based conclusions
- Author's craft analysis

**Example Verbs**: analyze, evaluate, synthesize, conclude, investigate

**Example Questions**:
- "How does the author's word choice create mood?"
- "Evaluate the strength of the argument."
- "What theme emerges from these events?"

---

#### DOK 4: Extended Thinking

**Cognitive Demand**: Apply understanding to new situations, create original connections

**Question Characteristics**:
- Extended time/investigation
- Multiple sources
- Original application
- Complex synthesis

**Example Verbs**: design, create, synthesize, apply, critique, connect

**Example Questions**:
- "How would you apply this concept to a new situation?"
- "Design an alternative solution based on the evidence."
- "Connect this text to historical events."

---

### DOK Selection Guidelines

| Question Goal | Recommended DOK |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Check basic comprehension | 1 |
| Assess skill application | 2 |
| Evaluate analytical thinking | 3 |
| Measure transfer/synthesis | 4 |

---

## Question Types & Design

### Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)

**Structure**:
- Stem (question)
- Four answer choices (A, B, C, D)
- One correct answer
- Three distractors

**Design Principles**:

1. **Stem Clarity**
   - Complete question in the stem
   - No unnecessary complexity
   - Avoid negatives when possible

2. **Choice Quality**
   - Parallel grammatical structure
   - Similar length
   - Plausible distractors
   - No "all of the above" or "none of the above"

3. **Distractor Design**
   - Based on common misconceptions
   - Logically related to correct answer
   - Not obviously wrong
   - Not too similar to correct answer

**DOK Support**: 1, 2, 3

---

### Short Response (SR)

**Structure**:
- Open-ended question
- Expected response (1-4 sentences)
- Scoring rubric

**Design Principles**:

1. **Clear Expectations**
   - Specific task instructions
   - Expected evidence type
   - Length guidance

2. **Evidence-Based**
   - Requires text citations
   - Supports reasoning

3. **Scorable**
   - Clear criteria
   - Objective evaluation possible

**DOK Support**: 1, 2, 3, 4

---

### Multipart Questions (MP)

**Structure**:
- Part A: Foundation question (often MCQ)
- Part B: Extension question that builds on Part A

**Design Principles**:

1. **Connected Parts**
   - Part B depends on Part A understanding
   - Progressive complexity
   - Coherent assessment goal

2. **Part A Design**
   - Establishes key concept
   - Often DOK 1-2
   - Sets up Part B

3. **Part B Design**
   - Extends Part A thinking
   - Requires application/analysis
   - Often DOK 2-3

**DOK Support**: 2, 3 (combined)

- **Complex character** development
- **Argument evaluation** in informational text

---

- **Cross-text synthesis**

---

## Assessment Quality Principles

### Validity

The question measures what it claims to measure.

**Checks in System**:
- `standard_alignment` - Assesses target standard
- `text_dependency` - Requires passage reading

### Reliability

Consistent results across similar conditions.

**Checks in System**:
- `single_correct_answer` - One defensible answer
- `clarity_precision` - Unambiguous wording

### Fairness

No advantage/disadvantage based on irrelevant factors.

**Checks in System**:
- `grammatical_parallel` - Equal structure
- `length_check` - Balanced choice lengths
- `plausibility` - Equally attractive options

### Accessibility

All students can demonstrate knowledge.

**Checks in System**:
- `specificity_balance` - Similar detail levels
- `homogeneity` - Same conceptual category

## Prompt Design Rationale

### Generation Prompts

#### Structure Rationale

Each generation prompt includes:

1. **Role Definition**
   - Establishes expertise context
   - Sets grade-level expectations
   - Defines output format

2. **Example Template**
   - Provides concrete pattern
   - Ensures consistency
   - Guides cognitive level

3. **DOK Requirements**
   - Explicit cognitive demand
   - Example verbs/processes
   - Quality indicators

4. **Constraints**
   - Length balance requirement
   - Text dependency requirement
   - Distractor quality guidance

#### MCQ DOK 1 Prompt Logic

```
Goal: Recall of directly stated information

Key Requirements:
- Information explicitly in text
- No inference needed
- Simple recognition task

Quality Constraints:
- Must require reading passage
- Distractors from same category
- Balanced answer lengths
```

#### MCQ DOK 2 Prompt Logic

```
Goal: Apply skills to make basic inferences

Key Requirements:
- Connect two+ pieces of information
- Classify or compare elements
- Explain simple relationships

Quality Constraints:
- Cannot answer by recall alone
- Evidence-based distractors

| Homogeneity | Keeps all choices conceptually aligned |
| Specificity Balance | Prevents detail-level cues |
| Length Balance | Prevents length-based test-taking strategies |
| Too-Close | Prevents unfair double-key scenarios |

#### Question Check Rationale

| Check | Educational Purpose |
|-------|---------------------|
| Standard Alignment | Ensures assessment validity |
| Clarity Precision | Removes construct-irrelevant variance |
| Text Dependency | Requires actual reading comprehension |
| Single Correct | Ensures reliability of scoring |
| Passage Reference | Prevents invalid structural references |
| Difficulty Assessment | Ensures grade appropriateness |

## Implementation in the System

### Standard Selection

When preparing input data, consider:

1. **Passage Fit**
   - Does the passage support this standard?
   - Is there sufficient evidence for questions?

2. **Grade Alignment**
   - Is the passage complexity appropriate?
   - Does vocabulary match grade level?

3. **DOK Compatibility**
   - Can the passage support the target DOK?
   - Are there enough details for higher DOK?

### Prompt Customization

The system supports prompt modification for:

1. **Grade-Specific Language**
   - Adjust vocabulary expectations
   - Modify complexity requirements

2. **Standard-Specific Focus**
   - Emphasize key skills
   - Include standard-aligned examples

3. **DOK-Level Tuning**
   - Adjust cognitive demand language
   - Modify example complexity
