When Toad says 'I feel sorry' followed by 'I found something much better to do,' he's expressing pity because he believes they're wasting time on inferior activities.

You found the clues about the \"shiny glass\" and \"beautiful leather seats\" that show Toad was amazed by the fancy car.", "B": "Good try! The crash happened after Toad saw the car, but the story shows he thought it was amazing with its shiny parts first.", "C": "Nice thinking, but Toad wasn't sad when he first saw the car. The story says it was \"amazing\" with beautiful seats before the crash.", "D": "Not quite! Toad wasn't thankful to anyone - he was amazed by how fancy and shiny the motor car looked."}, "original": {"A": "You successfully made a good inference about Toad\u2019s feelings by noticing the positive details about the car. The text supports this when it describes \u201cshiny glass,\u201d \u201cbeautiful leather seats,\u201d and even calls it \u201cthe amazing motor car,\u201d which suggests awe. Remember to look for positive or negative describing words to figure out how a character most likely feels in similar questions.", "B": "You may have focused on the crash and thought Toad felt bad, but the text says they saw \u201cshiny glass\u201d and \u201cbeautiful leather seats,\u201d and even calls it \u201cthe amazing motor car,\u201d which shows wonder, not shame. The correct answer is amazed because those fancy details and the word amazing signal excitement. Strategy: When a question asks about feelings, underline clue words the author uses (shiny, beautiful, amazing) and match them to a feeling from the text.", "C": "You may have focused on the crash and Rat\u2019s anger, which could feel sad, but that happens after the car passes. When Toad first sees it, the text calls it \u201cthe amazing motor car\u201d and describes \u201cshiny glass\u201d and \u201cbeautiful leather seats,\u201d which are positive clues showing wonder, not sadness. So the best answer is amazed because the words show he is impressed. Strategy: Reread the exact part the question points to and check if the words are positive or negative and whether it\u2019s before or after an event.", "D": "You may have focused on the nice features and thought Toad felt grateful, but the text says they saw \u201cshiny glass\u201d and \u201cbeautiful leather seats\u201d and even calls it \u201cthe amazing motor car,\u201d which shows he is amazed, not thankful. Right after, the car causes dust and a crash, and Rat is angry, so grateful doesn\u2019t fit. Next time, look for clue words that name the feeling and check that the events match that feeling."}}
{"question_id": "quiz_302082_sibling_1", "success": true, "rewritten": {"A": "Good try! Toad says \"This is the real life for a gentleman!\" with excitement, not sadness.

His happy words about \"the real life\" prove he's enjoying himself!", "C": "Not quite! Toad feels calm and happy when he says those words. The scary part with the motor car comes later in the story.", "D": "Nice thinking, but Toad knows exactly what he wants! He clearly loves the trip and feels sure \"this is the real life\" for him."}, "original": {"A": "This is incorrect. Toad's enthusiastic statement 'This is the real life for a gentleman!' shows he is enjoying himself, not feeling let down. The exclamation mark and positive words like 'real life' indicate satisfaction and pleasure, which are opposite to disappointment. His physical action of stretching out suggests comfort, not dissatisfaction.", "B": "This is correct. The passage describes Toad 'stretching out his legs' which is a physical sign of relaxation and comfort. His declaration 'This is the real life for a gentleman!' expresses contentment and satisfaction with the experience. The context shows this happens during the pleasant part of their journey when 'Everything was going well,' confirming Toad feels at ease and happy.", "C": "This is incorrect. Toad's statement comes during the calm, pleasant portion of the trip before the motor car appears. The text describes birds singing, other travelers being friendly, and 'a pleasant trip,' not anything scary. Fear comes later when the motor car suddenly appears, but Toad's relaxed stretching and positive words show he feels safe and content at this moment.", "D": "This is incorrect. Toad's clear, confident statement about 'the real life for a gentleman' shows he understands and appreciates what is happening. There is nothing in his words or actions that suggests uncertainty or bewilderment. Instead, his stretching and enthusiastic declaration demonstrate he feels sure this lifestyle suits him perfectly."}}
{"question_id": "quiz_302082_sibling_2", "success": true, "rewritten": {"A": "Good try! But curious means wanting to know about something. Rat was \"shaking both fists\" and shouting, which shows he's mad, not curious.", "B": "Not quite! Proud means feeling good about something. The story shows Rat yelling and shaking his fists because he's upset, not proud.", "C": "Great job! The passage says \"Rat was very angry\" and shows him \"shaking both fists.\" All his yelling and fist-shaking proves he feels furious.", "D": "Nice thinking, but nervous means scared or worried. Rat was bold and loud, \"shaking both fists\" and shouting at the drivers instead of acting scared."}, "original": {"A": "This is incorrect. Curiosity involves wanting to learn or know more about something. Rat's behavior of 'dancing up and down in the road' and 'shaking both fists in the air' while shouting 'You bad people!' shows intense anger, not interest in learning about the motor car or its drivers.", "B": "This is incorrect. Pride involves feeling satisfaction or pleasure in oneself or others. The passage shows Rat calling the drivers 'bad people' and 'mean drivers' and threatening to 'call the police,' which are expressions of outrage and anger, not pride. His aggressive gestures demonstrate he is upset, not pleased.", "C": "This is correct. The passage states 'Rat was very angry' directly. His actions support this: he 'danced up and down in the road,' shook 'both fists in the air,' and shouted insults like 'You bad people!' and 'You road hogs!' His threat to report them to police shows intense anger. All these details demonstrate Rat feels furious about what happened to their wagon.", "D": "This is incorrect. Nervous means feeling worried or anxious. Rat's aggressive actions of shaking fists, shouting, and threatening to call police show he feels bold and confrontational, not timid or worried. The text emphasizes his anger through words like 'very angry' and aggressive behaviors, not signs of nervousness."}}
{"question_id": "quiz_302082_sibling_3", "success": true, "rewritten": {"A": "You got it! The friends heard a strange sound \"like an animal in pain\" but didn't know what it was. They just went back to talking, showing they were confused about the weird noise.", "B": "Good try! But excited people would want to find out what made that strange sound. The friends just turned back to talking instead of investigating the weird noise.", "C": "Not quite! The friends weren't bored by the sound. They heard something strange \"like an animal in pain\" but didn't understand what it was, so they kept talking.", "D": "Nice thinking, but the friends weren't happy about the sound. Something that sounds \"like an animal in pain\" isn't delightful - it's confusing and strange!"}, "original": {"A": "This is correct. The passage describes the sound as 'faint' and coming from 'a small cloud of dust' in the distance. The comparison to 'an animal in pain' suggests the sound was strange and unclear. After hearing it, 'They turned to keep talking to each other,' showing they didn't understand what it was or didn't think it was important. This behavior indicates confusion or puzzlement about the unusual sound.", "B": "This is incorrect. Excitement involves enthusiasm and eager anticipation. The friends' reaction of simply turning back to their conversation shows they didn't recognize the sound as something thrilling. If they were excited, they would have stopped to investigate or commented on it. Instead, they dismissed it and continued talking, suggesting they were unsure what to make of it.", "C": "This is incorrect. Boredom means feeling uninterested or weary. While the friends did turn back to talking, this doesn't indicate boredom with the sound. The strange nature of the sound 'like an animal in pain' would catch attention rather than bore them. Their turning away shows they didn't understand its significance, not that they found it dull.", "D": "This is incorrect. Delight means great pleasure or joy. Nothing in the text suggests the friends felt happy about hearing a faint sound 'like an animal in pain.' This description creates an unsettling image, not a pleasant one. Their casual reaction of returning to conversation shows they didn't find it particularly pleasing or recognize what it meant."}}

That's not calm and peaceful behavior.", "D": "Nice thinking, but Rat isn't happy here. The story tells us he's angry and shouting mean things."}, "original": {"A": "This is incorrect. Respectful means showing polite regard for someone. Rat calls the drivers 'bad people,' 'mean drivers,' and 'road hogs,' which are insults showing disrespect. His threat to 'call the police' and 'report you' demonstrates he thinks they deserve punishment, not respect. These actions are the opposite of being respectful.", "B": "This is correct. Outraged means feeling shocked and very angry about something unjust. The passage shows Rat 'danced up and down in the road' and shook 'both fists in the air' - intense physical expressions of anger. His shouted insults and threats show he feels the drivers acted wrongly and unfairly, causing unjust harm. The text directly states 'Rat was very angry,' confirming his outrage.", "C": "This is incorrect. Peaceful means calm and tranquil. Rat's violent gestures of dancing up and down while shaking both fists show he is highly agitated, not calm. His loud shouting and angry words like 'You bad people!' demonstrate intense emotional disturbance, which is the opposite of feeling peaceful.", "D": "This is incorrect. Cheerful means happy and in good spirits. The passage emphasizes Rat's anger through direct statement ('Rat was very angry') and through his hostile actions and words. Nothing about shouting insults, shaking fists, and threatening to call police suggests happiness. Rat is expressing fury, not cheer."}}
