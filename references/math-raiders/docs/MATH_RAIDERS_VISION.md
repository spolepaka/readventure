# Math Raiders: The Automaticity Engine

## Mission
Build unshakeable mathematical foundations by turning repetitive practice into social play. We make instant recall of fundamental math facts inevitable through multiplayer gaming.

## Core Insight
Most kids never achieve automaticity (instant recall) of basic math facts. This creates a cascade of failure through their entire math education. Math Raiders solves this through social gameplay that delivers thousands of enjoyable repetitions.

We're not teaching math concepts - we're building automaticity through play.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Automaticity Science (The WHAT)
- Instant recall of multiplication facts (0-12)
- Instant recall of division facts
- Instant recall of addition/subtraction facts
- Common fraction operations
- **Not calculated, but KNOWN** - like knowing your name

### 2. Actionable Gamification (The HOW)
- **Core Drive 2**: Achievement & Progress (see your speed increase)
- **Core Drive 5**: Social Influence (raid with friends daily)
- **Core Drive 3**: Empowerment (choose your challenge level)
- White hat only - no manipulation, just fun

### 3. The 1,000 Hour Journey (The GOAL)
- ~500 core facts to master
- 100-200 repetitions each for automaticity
- 50,000-100,000 total problems
- Achieved through 1-2 years of daily play
- Result: Instant recall under any pressure

## What is Automaticity?

### Current State (Most Kids):
```
7 × 8 = ? 
*thinks* "7...8...56!" (2-3 seconds)
Result: Cognitive overload in algebra
```

### Automaticity (Our Goal):
```
7 × 8 = 56 (instant, no thinking)
Result: Brain free for higher math
```

This isn't about being "quick at math" - it's about certain facts being as automatic as breathing.

## Game Design

### Core Loop (90 seconds)
1. **Boss Appears** (5s): "Enemy with 300 HP!"
2. **Battle Phase** (30s): Problems appear rapidly, instant answers deal damage
3. **Victory** (10s): Celebrate speed and accuracy
4. **Social Time** (15s): Chat, emotes, prepare for next wave

### The Repetition Engine
- Session: 50-100 problems (10-15 minutes)
- Day: 200-400 problems (1 hour play)
- Week: 1,500-3,000 problems
- Month: 6,000-12,000 problems
- Year: 75,000-150,000 problems
- **Result**: True automaticity

### What Makes It Addictive
- See your speed improve daily
- Race friends in real-time
- Social pressure to show up
- Immediate feedback on every answer
- Progress visible to everyone

## Scope: Laser Focus

### What We Build Automaticity For:
- **Multiplication**: 0×0 through 12×12 (144 facts)
- **Division**: Inverse of above (144 facts)
- **Addition**: 0+0 through 20+20 (200 key facts)
- **Subtraction**: Inverse of above (200 key facts)
- **Fractions**: Common operations (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.)

### What We DON'T Do:
- Word problems
- Complex reasoning
- Algebra concepts
- Geometry
- "Understanding" - that's their teacher's job

**We do ONE thing perfectly: Make basics automatic.**

## Target Audience

### Primary: Grades 2-5 (Ages 7-11)
- Critical window for building automaticity
- Still motivated by games and friends
- Teachers desperate for fluency solutions
- Parents see immediate results

### Success Metrics:
- Can answer any basic fact in <0.5 seconds
- Maintain accuracy under social pressure
- Want to play without being asked
- Show measurable speed improvements

## Technical Architecture

### Why SpacetimeDB
- Real-time multiplayer (see friends' answers)
- Cheat-proof (server validates everything)
- Built for rapid updates (10+ problems/minute)
- Social features built-in

### Frontend: React + Pixi.js
- React for rapid UI updates
- Pixi.js for satisfying visual feedback
- Optimized for speed, not graphics

## Business Model

### Phase 1: Prove Automaticity Works
- 100 kids, 6-week trial
- Measure: Facts per minute before/after
- Target: 3x speed improvement

### Phase 2: School Partnerships
- Sell to schools as "automaticity supplement"
- Teacher dashboards showing speed progress
- Replace worksheet homework

### Phase 3: Expand Carefully
- Add more fact types only after proving model
- Maintain laser focus on automaticity
- Resist feature creep

## Why This Wins

### vs. Kumon/Worksheets
- Same repetition principle
- 10x more engaging
- Kids actually do it

### vs. Educational Games
- We don't teach concepts
- We build automaticity
- Measurable, specific outcome

### vs. Math Academy
- They teach everything
- We perfect one thing
- Complementary, not competitive

## The Defensible Moat

1. **Network Effects**: More fun with more friends
2. **Habit Formation**: Daily raids become routine
3. **Switching Costs**: Lose progress and friends
4. **Simplicity**: Parents understand "instant recall"

## The North Star

**Success**: A generation of kids who have instant recall of all basic math facts because they raided with friends for 15 minutes after school every day. When they hit algebra, nothing holds them back because 7×8 isn't a calculation - it's just known.

## Next Steps

1. Build MVP: Multiplication facts only (0-12)
2. 50 kids, 6-week trial
3. Measure facts/minute improvement
4. Ship only if we achieve 3x speed gain
