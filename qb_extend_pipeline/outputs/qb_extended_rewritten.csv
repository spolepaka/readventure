        There once was a poor boy named Aladdin. His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

---

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

---

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place.

When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. ""Tell me, young man,"" said the stranger. ""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag.

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me.

""Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?""""Yes, I am,"" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. ""My dear nephew!"" he cried out. ""Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!""

---

Aladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.

---

The next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. ""Come with me today,"" he said to the boy. ""I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city."" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.""Go gather some dry sticks,"" the magician told Aladdin. ""We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.""Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.

---

""Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,"" said the magician. ""It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.""Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.""Take this special ring,"" said the magician. ""It will keep you safe from any harm."" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.""Give me your hand, Uncle,"" Aladdin called out. ""Help me climb out!""""First, hand me the lamp,"" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. ""I cannot reach it right now,"" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp.

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp.

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there.

His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

""My lord,"" she said, ""my son Aladdin wants to marry your daughter."" The Sultan laughed loudly. ""Your son and my daughter? That's silly!"" But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought. ""I have never seen such beautiful gems!"" Then the Sultan said, ""Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.""

        Aladdin was stuck in the dark cave. ""Uncle!"" he called out. ""Please help me!"" But no one answered. The magician had gone back to North Africa. He only wanted the magic lamp. Since Aladdin would not help him get it, he did not care about Aladdin anymore.For three whole days, Aladdin stayed in the black cave. First, he yelled for help. Then, he cried. Finally, he put his hands together to pray. When he did this, he rubbed the ring on his finger. The magician had put this ring there. Suddenly, a genie appeared in front of him.""What do you wish for?"" asked the genie of the ring.Aladdin was scared, but he said, ""Take me out of this cave!"" In a flash, Aladdin found himself outside again. He ran home fast to tell his mother everything that had happened. He showed her the beautiful gems from the cave. His mother thought they were just pretty stones. Then, he showed her the old lamp.

""This lamp is so dirty,"" said Aladdin's mother. ""Let me clean it. Then maybe I can sell it to buy us some food."" She took a cloth and started rubbing the lamp. All at once, a huge genie appeared! This genie was much bigger than the first one.""What is your wish?"" the genie thundered in a loud voice.Aladdin's mother was so frightened she almost fell down. Aladdin quickly said, ""We are very hungry! Please bring us something to eat!"" The genie disappeared and came back with twelve gold plates full of delicious food.

But when Aladdin's mother opened her cloth and showed the gems, the Sultan stopped laughing. He looked closely at the sparkling stones.""These are amazing!"" the Sultan thought. ""I have never seen such beautiful gems!"" Then the Sultan said, ""Your son may marry my daughter, but only if he sends me forty servants. Each servant must carry a bowl full of gems like these.""

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

---

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

        Alice had just drunk from a strange little bottle. The liquid tasted very odd and made her feel funny.""What a strange feeling!"" said Alice. She was getting smaller and smaller. Soon, she was only ten inches tall. Now she was the perfect size to go through the tiny door to the beautiful garden. But when Alice got to the door, she realized something terrible. She had forgotten the little golden key on the table!Alice went back to get the key, but now she had a big problem. She was too short to reach the table! Alice sat down and started to cry. Then she noticed a small glass box under the table. Inside the box was a tiny cake with the words 'EAT ME' written on top with small pieces of fruit.

""I will eat this cake,"" Alice said with excitement. As soon as she took a bite, something amazing happened.""How strange!"" cried Alice. ""Now I am growing bigger and bigger! I can barely see my feet!"" Alice grew so tall that her head hit the ceiling of the hall. She was now nine feet tall! She quickly grabbed the golden key and ran to the garden door. But now she had the opposite problem. She was much too big to fit through the doorway. All she could do was look into the garden with one eye.Alice felt so sad that she sat down and cried again. She cried so many tears that they made a big pool of water around her. While she was crying, Alice heard footsteps. It was the White Rabbit coming back! He looked very fancy with white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand.

---

The White Rabbit was talking to himself. ""Oh no! The Duchess will be so angry if I am late!"" When Alice tried to talk to him, the Rabbit got scared. He dropped his gloves and fan and ran away quickly into the dark.""Everything is so weird today!"" said Alice. As she spoke, Alice noticed she was getting smaller again. Suddenly, splash! She fell into the pool of water she had made with her own tears. Poor Alice had to swim around in her own tear pool!""I wish I had not cried so much!"" Alice said as she swam around looking for a way out. Alice was not the type of person to sit still and do nothing. After she got out of the pool, she decided to explore more of Wonderland.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

---

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

---

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

---

In front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, ""Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!"" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. ""That was not there before,"" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

---

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

---

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

In front of her was a long tunnel. The White Rabbit was rushing down it. Alice ran after him. She heard him say, ""Oh my ears and whiskers, how late I am getting!"" Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. ""That was not there before,"" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together.

Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

        Alice was getting very tired of sitting by her sister near the river. There was nothing fun to do. She looked at her sister's book once or twice. But the book had no pictures in it. It had no talking between people either.""What good is a book without pictures or talking?"" Alice thought to herself.It was a very hot day. The heat made Alice feel sleepy. She thought about making a chain of flowers from daisies. But she would have to get up and pick the flowers. She wondered if it would be worth all that work. Just then, a White Rabbit ran right past her!

---

At first, Alice did not think this was strange. She did not even think it was weird when the Rabbit said to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh dear! I will be too late!"" But then something amazing happened. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of its pocket! Alice jumped up to her feet right away. She ran after the Rabbit and watched him jump down a big rabbit hole.Alice followed the Rabbit down the hole. She did not think about how she would get back out again. The rabbit hole went down very suddenly. Alice found herself falling down what looked like a very deep well.The well was very deep, or maybe she was falling very slowly. Either way, she had lots of time to look around her. She looked at the sides of the well as she fell. There were cupboards and bookshelves all along the walls.

---

""Well!"" Alice thought to herself. ""After falling like this, I will never be scared of falling down stairs again!""Down, down, down she fell. Would this fall ever end? ""I wonder how many miles I have fallen,"" Alice said out loud. ""I must be getting close to the center of the earth. That would be about four thousand miles down, I think. What if I fall all the way through the earth? How funny it would be to come out where people walk upside down! I will have to ask them what their country is called.""Alice was starting to fall asleep when suddenly, thump! She landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves. Alice was not hurt at all. She got up and looked around.

Alice thought she was catching up to the White Rabbit. But when she turned the corner, he was gone!Alice found herself in a long, low room. There were many doors, but they were all locked. She wondered how she would ever get out. Then she saw a little table with three legs. It was made of clear glass. On top was a tiny, golden key. But the key would not open any of the doors.Then Alice saw a curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock. It worked! The door led to a small tunnel. Alice looked through and saw the most beautiful garden ever. She wanted to leave the dark room and walk in the garden. But the doorway was too tiny. She could not even fit her head through it.Alice went back to the table. This time, she found a little bottle on it. ""That was not there before,"" said Alice. The bottle had a label that said 'DRINK ME.' Alice looked to see if it said Poison anywhere. It did not, so Alice decided to taste it. It tasted like many good things mixed together.

Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat. ""Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!""Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly.

        Alice kept walking through Wonderland until she found a strange cat sitting on a tree branch. This was the Cheshire Cat, and he had a huge grin on his face. Alice was getting tired of all the odd things in Wonderland. She wanted to find her way home.""Cheshire Cat,"" Alice said politely, ""can you please tell me which way I should go from here?""""That depends on where you want to go,"" said the Cat with his big smile.""I don't really care where I go,"" Alice replied.""Then it doesn't matter which path you take,"" the Cat said back to her.""I just want to get somewhere,"" Alice added quickly.""Oh, you will definitely get somewhere if you keep walking long enough,"" said the Cat.

---

Alice tried asking another question. ""What kind of people live around here?""The Cat pointed his right paw in one direction. ""Over that way lives a Mad Hatter. Over there lives a March Hare. You can visit either one if you want. But they are both completely mad.""""I don't want to visit crazy people,"" Alice said with worry.""You can't help that here,"" said the Cat. ""Everyone in this place is mad, including me and you!""Then something very strange happened. The Cat began to disappear slowly. First his tail vanished, then his body, and finally everything was gone except his grin. The smile stayed floating in the air for a while after the rest of him had disappeared.""How curious!"" Alice thought to herself. ""A grin without a cat! I have never seen anything like that before!""

---

Alice continued walking until she came to a house. In front of the house was a large table set up for tea time. The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sitting at the table having tea. Between them sat a sleepy Dormouse. Even though the table was very big, all three of them were crowded together at just one corner.""No room! No room!"" they shouted when they saw Alice coming toward them.""There is plenty of room!"" Alice said angrily. She sat down in a big chair at the end of the table.""Have some lemonade,"" the March Hare offered.Alice looked around the whole table carefully. ""I don't see any lemonade anywhere,"" she said.""There isn't any lemonade,"" the March Hare replied.""Then it was not very nice of you to offer it to me,"" Alice said with anger.""It was not very nice of you to sit down when nobody invited you,"" the March Hare shot back.

""You might as well say that 'I see what I eat' means the same thing as 'I eat what I see!'""The sleepy Dormouse added, ""You might as well say that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same as 'I sleep when I breathe!'""The Mad Hatter turned back to Alice.

""What is the answer?""""I have no idea,"" said the Mad Hatter.""Neither do I,"" said the March Hare.Alice thought to herself, ""This is the strangest tea party I have ever been to in my whole life!""

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

---

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

---

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

Just at that moment, Alice woke up! She was lying on the river bank next to her sister. The sun was still shining brightly and it was a beautiful day. Alice was so excited to tell her sister about her amazing dream and all her adventures in Wonderland.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

        Alice walked deeper into Wonderland and found something amazing. There was a door inside a tree! The door opened to a long hallway. This hallway led to the same beautiful garden she had seen before. When Alice entered the garden, she could not believe her eyes. There were so many people there! She saw royal helpers, royal children, and even the King and Queen of Hearts. They were getting ready to play a game called croquet. The Queen asked Alice if she wanted to play too.The croquet game was very strange and messy. The ground was bumpy with hills and holes everywhere. But that was not the strangest part. The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon.

The croquet balls were actually live hedgehogs! The mallets they used to hit the balls were real flamingos. Alice had a hard time holding her flamingo mallet. It kept moving around because it was alive. The hedgehog balls kept walking away from where she wanted to hit them. All the players played at the same time instead of taking turns. The Queen got very angry and kept shouting, ""Off with his head!"" and ""Off with her head!"" at everyone.

---

Alice was lucky to get away from the crazy croquet game. The Queen took her to meet someone called the Mock Turtle. On the way, Alice met a creature called the Gryphon. Alice had never heard of a Mock Turtle or a Gryphon before. She asked what they were, but nobody gave her an answer that made sense. These were just two more strange creatures that lived in Wonderland.The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon told Alice and the Queen stories about when they went to school. They talked about the subjects they studied. These subjects had funny names like Reeling, Writhing, and Ambition. They also studied ancient and modern Mystery. Alice was sure she had never studied any of these subjects in her real school. The conversation was very odd and confusing.

---

Suddenly, someone came running with important news. A trial was starting! Alice ran with the Gryphon to see what was happening. The Knave of Hearts was on trial for stealing some tarts. Just like the croquet game, the trial was a complete mess. The witnesses did not help at all. Then something very strange happened. Alice was called to be a witness too! The Queen said they should announce the punishment before the jury decided if the person was guilty or not. This made Alice very upset.""Stuff and nonsense!"" Alice said loudly. ""The idea of having the sentence first!"" The Queen's face turned purple with anger. ""Hold your tongue!"" she yelled. ""I won't!"" Alice replied bravely. ""Off with her head!"" screamed the Queen.

        Lunch was wonderful at Toad Hall. The food was always good there. During the meal, Toad talked to Mole about taking a trip. Toad was very good at talking people into things. He told Mole all about the fun they would have on the open road. He made it sound like the best thing in the world. Mole got so excited that he could hardly sit still in his chair. In the end, Rat let Toad and Mole change his mind. He did not want to disappoint his friends. So after lunch, they loaded up the wagon and set off on their adventure.

It was a beautiful golden afternoon. The dust from the road smelled rich and good. Birds sang to them from the thick fruit trees on both sides of the road. Other travelers called out ""Good day!"" to them. Some people stopped to say nice things about their beautiful wagon.""Ah,"" said Toad, stretching out his legs. ""This is the real life for a gentleman!"" They had a pleasant trip along the narrow country roads. Everything was going well until they reached the big highway. That is where disaster struck them.

They were walking along the highway when they saw a small cloud of dust. It was coming toward them very fast. From the dust cloud, they heard a faint ""toot-toot!"" It sounded like an animal in pain. They turned to keep talking to each other. But in just one moment, everything changed completely. With a big blast of wind and a whirl of loud sound, it was right on top of them! They had to jump into the nearest ditch to get out of the way.

The horn of the motor car rang out loudly, ""TOOT-TOOT!"" They got a quick look inside the car. It had shiny glass and beautiful leather seats. Then the amazing motor car threw a huge cloud of dust that made it hard for them to see. The car got smaller and smaller as it drove away into the distance.The old grey horse got scared and jumped forward. Then there was a terrible crash. Their beautiful yellow wagon fell over on its side in the ditch. Rat was very angry. He danced up and down in the road. ""You bad people!"" he shouted, shaking both fists in the air.
