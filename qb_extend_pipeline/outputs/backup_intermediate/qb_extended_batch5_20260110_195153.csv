        Birds live all around the world. They come in many sizes and colors. Some birds are very big, and some are very small. Hummingbirds are some of the smallest birds on Earth. The bee hummingbird is only two inches long. It weighs less than a penny!
Hummingbirds are amazing little animals. They can flap their wings up to 90 times in one second. That is so fast that their wings look like a blur. It is hard to see their wings because they move so quickly. These tiny birds can hover in the air like a helicopter. They can also fly backwards and upside-down. No other birds can do this!

Hummingbirds fly from flower to flower like busy bees. They use their long, pointy beaks to drink sweet nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sugary liquid that gives them lots of energy. Since they flap their wings so much, they need to eat a lot of food. A hummingbird will visit hundreds of flowers every day. It drinks more than its own weight in nectar! They also eat small insects they find on the flowers.
These birds love red flowers the most. People hang red feeders filled with sugary water to attract them. The feeders are dyed red because hummingbirds are drawn to this bright color. Many people enjoy watching these fast little birds at their feeders.

Many hummingbirds migrate to different places during the year. The ruby-throated hummingbird lives in the eastern United States during spring and summer. When autumn comes, it flies south to warmer places. This tiny bird makes an incredible journey. It flies 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico without stopping! From there, it may continue south through Mexico to Costa Rica and other countries.
Hummingbird nests are very small. They are about half the size of a walnut shell. The birds make their nests using tiny pieces of moss and leaves. They use spider webs to hold everything together. The spider web works like glue because it is sticky. It is also flexible, which means it can stretch and bend.

A hummingbird lays two tiny eggs in its nest. When the babies hatch and start to grow, the spider web stretches to make the nest bigger. This helps keep the babies warm and safe as they get larger.

While hummingbirds do fly to many flowers, 'hover' doesn't mean flying in circles. Look at the comparison in the text: 'hover in the air like a helicopter.' Consider what a helicopter does when it hovers - it remains still in one spot, not circling around.","This is incorrect. Hovering is a type of flying, not landing.

        Birds live all around the world. They come in many sizes and colors. Some birds are very big, and some are very small. Hummingbirds are some of the smallest birds on Earth. The bee hummingbird is only two inches long. It weighs less than a penny!
Hummingbirds are amazing little animals. They can flap their wings up to 90 times in one second. That is so fast that their wings look like a blur. It is hard to see their wings because they move so quickly. These tiny birds can hover in the air like a helicopter. They can also fly backwards and upside-down. No other birds can do this!

        Birds live all around the world. They come in many sizes and colors. Some birds are very big, and some are very small. Hummingbirds are some of the smallest birds on Earth. The bee hummingbird is only two inches long. It weighs less than a penny!
Hummingbirds are amazing little animals. They can flap their wings up to 90 times in one second. That is so fast that their wings look like a blur. It is hard to see their wings because they move so quickly. These tiny birds can hover in the air like a helicopter. They can also fly backwards and upside-down. No other birds can do this!

---

Hummingbirds fly from flower to flower like busy bees. They use their long, pointy beaks to drink sweet nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sugary liquid that gives them lots of energy. Since they flap their wings so much, they need to eat a lot of food. A hummingbird will visit hundreds of flowers every day. It drinks more than its own weight in nectar! They also eat small insects they find on the flowers.
These birds love red flowers the most. People hang red feeders filled with sugary water to attract them. The feeders are dyed red because hummingbirds are drawn to this bright color. Many people enjoy watching these fast little birds at their feeders.

---

Many hummingbirds migrate to different places during the year. The ruby-throated hummingbird lives in the eastern United States during spring and summer. When autumn comes, it flies south to warmer places. This tiny bird makes an incredible journey. It flies 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico without stopping! From there, it may continue south through Mexico to Costa Rica and other countries.
Hummingbird nests are very small. They are about half the size of a walnut shell. The birds make their nests using tiny pieces of moss and leaves. They use spider webs to hold everything together. The spider web works like glue because it is sticky. It is also flexible, which means it can stretch and bend.

The passage never mentions noise, sounds, or warnings related to the spider web. The text explains 'When the babies hatch and start to grow, the spider web stretches to make the nest bigger.

        Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. Some of you may remember me from when you were in first grade. I came to your school to teach you about your body. I told you to eat healthy food so you would grow big and strong. It looks like you listened! You have grown so much since then!
Today I am here to teach you more about your body and how it works. We will learn about three important systems. These are the skeletal system, the muscular system, and the nervous system. Each system has a special job to help your body work.

---

Let's start with the skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of all the bones in your body. These bones give your body its shape. I have pictures on my computer to show you. You have more than 200 bones in your body! When I went to medical school, I had to learn the name of every single bone. That was very hard work!
Let's begin at the top with your skull. Doctors also call the skull the cranium. Your skull has a very important job. It protects your brain, which is a soft organ inside your head. You might think your skull is one big bone, but it's not! Your skull is actually made of 22 different bones that fit together.

---

Now rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone there? That is part of your spine. Your spine is made of more than thirty small bones stacked on top of each other. Each small bone is called a vertebra. All these bones together protect your spinal cord, which sends messages to your brain.
If you tap on your chest, you can feel your breastbone. The medical name for this bone is the sternum. If you tap to the left or right, you might feel your ribs. Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs. The ribs look like a cage around these organs. Behind your ribs are two bones shaped like a triangle. These are your shoulder blade bones. The medical name for shoulder blade is scapula.

---

The pelvis is the group of bones at your hips. In your lower leg, you have two important bones. The tibia is the bigger bone, and the fibula is the smaller one next to it.
Now let's play Simon Says to practice these bone names! When you take a deep breath, watch how your rib cage can expand to make room for air. Your skeletal system works with your muscular system and nervous system to help you move and stay healthy. Are you ready to play?
Simon says, tap your skull! Simon says, now tap your cranium! Did I trick you? They are the same bone! Simon says, bend over and touch your tibia. Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your ribs expand. Now touch your scapula! Wait - I didn't say Simon says!",,,,,"Based on the information in the text, what is the main purpose of the ribs in your body?",MCQ,to allow your chest to expand when you breathe deeply,to protect important organs like your heart and lungs,to connect your shoulder blades to your breastbone,to send messages from your body to your brain,B,"Incorrect. While Dr. Welbody mentions in the Simon Says game that 'your rib cage can expand to make room for air,' this is a function during breathing, not the main purpose. The text clearly states the primary job is protection: 'Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs.' Look for what the text identifies as the bone's main job.","Correct! The text explicitly states: 'Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs. The ribs look like a cage around these organs.' This directly answers what the ribs' purpose is. When a passage tells you what something does or its job, that's the key information to use.","Incorrect. The text mentions shoulder blades (scapula) are 'behind your ribs,' but never states that ribs connect these bones. You may be confusing the location of bones with their function. Reread the paragraph about ribs to find what job they actually perform.","Incorrect. This describes the job of the spinal cord, not the ribs.

Now rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone there? That is part of your spine. Your spine is made of more than thirty small bones stacked on top of each other. Each small bone is called a vertebra. All these bones together protect your spinal cord, which sends messages to your brain.
If you tap on your chest, you can feel your breastbone. The medical name for this bone is the sternum. If you tap to the left or right, you might feel your ribs. Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs. The ribs look like a cage around these organs. Behind your ribs are two bones shaped like a triangle. These are your shoulder blade bones. The medical name for shoulder blade is scapula.

The pelvis is the group of bones at your hips. In your lower leg, you have two important bones. The tibia is the bigger bone, and the fibula is the smaller one next to it.
Now let's play Simon Says to practice these bone names! When you take a deep breath, watch how your rib cage can expand to make room for air. Your skeletal system works with your muscular system and nervous system to help you move and stay healthy. Are you ready to play?
Simon says, tap your skull! Simon says, now tap your cranium! Did I trick you? They are the same bone! Simon says, bend over and touch your tibia. Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your ribs expand. Now touch your scapula! Wait - I didn't say Simon says!",,,,,Dr. Welbody mentions playing Simon Says to practice bone names. What does this activity reveal about how she wants students to learn?,MCQ,She believes students learn best when they can move their bodies and interact with the content physically,She thinks students need to be tricked into learning by disguising lessons as games,She wants to show that skeletal system knowledge is only useful during game activities,She prefers that students focus on following directions rather than understanding concepts,A,"Correct! The text shows Dr. Welbody consistently combines physical activity with learning: having students touch bones during the lesson and then playing Simon Says to practice names while moving. The passage states the game helps 'practice these bone names' and demonstrates how 'your skeletal system works with your muscular system and nervous system to help you move.' This reveals her belief in active, kinesthetic learning.","Incorrect. Dr. Welbody isn't disguising or tricking—she's open about her teaching purpose, stating 'let's play Simon Says to practice these bone names!' The game is an explicit educational tool, not a deception. Her approach shows she values making learning engaging, not hiding it.","Incorrect. The game is one application, but the text shows bone knowledge has real importance: bones 'give your body its shape,' protect organs, and 'help you move and stay healthy.' The Simon Says game is a practice method, not the only use for this knowledge. Dr. Welbody emphasizes practical body understanding.","Incorrect. While Simon Says involves following directions, Dr. Welbody's goal is clearly conceptual understanding. She teaches what bones do, where they're located, and their medical names before the game. The directions are a vehicle for practicing concepts, not the main focus. Review how she builds understanding before the activity.",3,easy,RI.3.1,3,quiz_302216,2026-01-10T19:58:15.118590,Targets end section analyzing Dr. Welbody's pedagogical philosophy through Simon Says - differs from reference by asking WHY she uses games (teaching philosophy) vs WHAT the game accomplishes (outcome).

        Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. Some of you may remember me from when you were in first grade. I came to your school to teach you about your body. I told you to eat healthy food so you would grow big and strong. It looks like you listened! You have grown so much since then!
Today I am here to teach you more about your body and how it works. We will learn about three important systems. These are the skeletal system, the muscular system, and the nervous system. Each system has a special job to help your body work.

---

Let's start with the skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of all the bones in your body. These bones give your body its shape. I have pictures on my computer to show you. You have more than 200 bones in your body! When I went to medical school, I had to learn the name of every single bone. That was very hard work!
Let's begin at the top with your skull. Doctors also call the skull the cranium. Your skull has a very important job. It protects your brain, which is a soft organ inside your head. You might think your skull is one big bone, but it's not! Your skull is actually made of 22 different bones that fit together.

Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your ribs expand. Now touch your scapula! Wait - I didn't say Simon says!",,,,,"Based on how Dr. Welbody presents information in the text, what can you conclude about her approach to teaching medical concepts to third graders?",MCQ,She simplifies complex anatomy by introducing both common and medical terms gradually,She focuses only on the most difficult bone names that students must memorize,She avoids using any medical terminology to prevent confusing young students,She expects students to learn as much as doctors learn in medical school,A,"Correct! Throughout the text, Dr. Welbody introduces common terms first (skull, shoulder blade, breastbone) then adds medical terms (cranium, scapula, sternum), saying things like 'Doctors also call the skull the cranium.' She balances accessibility with proper terminology, making complex concepts manageable. This gradual introduction helps students build vocabulary without being overwhelmed.","Incorrect. Dr. Welbody doesn't focus on difficult names—she teaches a range from simple (ribs, spine) to complex (scapula, vertebra). She mentions medical school was 'very hard work' but doesn't expect the same level from third graders. Review how she introduces various bones with different complexity levels.","Incorrect. The text clearly shows Dr. Welbody DOES use medical terminology—cranium, sternum, scapula, vertebra, tibia, fibula. However, she introduces these alongside common terms to build understanding. She doesn't avoid medical words; she makes them accessible. Reread to see how many medical terms she actually teaches.","Incorrect. While Dr. Welbody mentions she 'had to learn the name of every single bone' in medical school and that it 'was very hard work,' she doesn't expect this from students.

Dr. Welbody references the first-grade visit ('I told you to eat healthy food') then states 'Today I am here to teach you more about your body.' The word 'more' signals building on foundations. She taught basic health then; now she's teaching specific systems (skeletal, muscular, nervous). This shows progressive, developmental learning appropriate for older students.","Incorrect. Dr. Welbody doesn't suggest students should already know this—she says she's here to teach them 'more,' indicating new content. She compliments their growth ('You have grown so much!') rather than criticizing lack of knowledge. The tone is encouraging and forward-looking, not remedial. Review the opening paragraph's positive framing.","Incorrect. The text explicitly introduces new information. In first grade, she taught about eating healthy; now she's teaching about three body systems with specific bone names and structures. The word 'more' in 'teach you more about your body' signals additional, not repeated, content. Compare what was taught before versus now.","Incorrect.

Medical terms without familiar anchors (knowing 'skull' helps learn 'cranium') are harder to grasp and remember. Research on learning shows connecting new knowledge to existing knowledge aids memory. One term doesn't automatically mean easier learning when that term is unfamiliar.","Correct! Throughout the text, Dr. Welbody uses a teaching strategy of pairing familiar terms with medical ones: 'your skull...Doctors also call the skull the cranium.' This scaffolding helps students connect what they already know (everyday words) to new vocabulary (medical terms). Without this bridge, students would struggle to visualize and understand what abstract medical terms refer to. The pictures showing only medical terms would lose this crucial connection point.","Incorrect. Professional-sounding terms don't automatically improve memory—meaningful connections do. Third graders are more likely to remember information they can relate to their experiences. When Dr. Welbody says 'tap on your chest, you can feel your breastbone,' the familiar term 'breastbone' helps them connect the physical sensation to the concept. 'Sternum' alone lacks this experiential anchor.","Incorrect. Dr. Welbody could still use medical terms during Simon Says—the issue isn't game clarity but initial learning. The game happens after the lesson when students already know the terms. The real problem would occur during the teaching phase when students first encounter bones.

        Hello! My name is Dr. Welbody. Some of you may remember me from when you were in first grade. I came to your school to teach you about your body. I told you to eat healthy food so you would grow big and strong. It looks like you listened! You have grown so much since then!
Today I am here to teach you more about your body and how it works. We will learn about three important systems. These are the skeletal system, the muscular system, and the nervous system. Each system has a special job to help your body work.

---

Let's start with the skeletal system. The skeletal system is made up of all the bones in your body. These bones give your body its shape. I have pictures on my computer to show you. You have more than 200 bones in your body! When I went to medical school, I had to learn the name of every single bone. That was very hard work!
Let's begin at the top with your skull. Doctors also call the skull the cranium. Your skull has a very important job. It protects your brain, which is a soft organ inside your head. You might think your skull is one big bone, but it's not! Your skull is actually made of 22 different bones that fit together.

---

Now rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone there? That is part of your spine. Your spine is made of more than thirty small bones stacked on top of each other. Each small bone is called a vertebra. All these bones together protect your spinal cord, which sends messages to your brain.
If you tap on your chest, you can feel your breastbone. The medical name for this bone is the sternum. If you tap to the left or right, you might feel your ribs. Your ribs protect important organs like your heart and lungs. The ribs look like a cage around these organs. Behind your ribs are two bones shaped like a triangle. These are your shoulder blade bones. The medical name for shoulder blade is scapula.

---

The pelvis is the group of bones at your hips. In your lower leg, you have two important bones. The tibia is the bigger bone, and the fibula is the smaller one next to it.
Now let's play Simon Says to practice these bone names! When you take a deep breath, watch how your rib cage can expand to make room for air. Your skeletal system works with your muscular system and nervous system to help you move and stay healthy. Are you ready to play?
Simon says, tap your skull! Simon says, now tap your cranium! Did I trick you? They are the same bone! Simon says, bend over and touch your tibia. Simon says, take a deep breath and feel your ribs expand. Now touch your scapula! Wait - I didn't say Simon says!",,,,,"The text mentions that Dr. Welbody has pictures on her computer to show students. Based on everything Dr. Welbody teaches, what would be most important for these pictures to include to support her lesson goals?",MCQ,Labels showing where each bone is located in the body and what organs or body parts it protects,Information about how much each individual bone weighs and what material bones are made from,Comparisons showing how human bones are different from animal bones in size and structure,Historical facts about when doctors first discovered each bone and named it with medical terms,A,"Correct! Throughout the lesson, Dr. Welbody emphasizes two key concepts: location ('your skull,' 'at the back of your neck,' 'in your lower leg') and protective function ('protects your brain,' 'protect your spinal cord,' 'protect important organs like your heart and lungs'). Pictures showing location and protection would directly support these core teaching goals. Her entire lesson structure focuses on where bones are and what they protect.","Incorrect. Dr. Welbody never discusses bone weight or composition. Her lesson focuses on location, names, and protective functions. While bone material might be interesting, it doesn't align with her stated teaching objectives about the skeletal system's structure and role. Review what concepts she actually emphasizes throughout the text.","Incorrect. Dr. Welbody teaches exclusively about human anatomy without any animal comparisons. Her goal is helping students understand their own bodies, not comparative anatomy. While such comparisons could be educational, they don't match her lesson's focus on personal body awareness. Reread to see if animals are mentioned anywhere.","Incorrect. The text contains no historical information about bone discovery or naming. Dr. Welbody focuses on present-day anatomy and function, not history of medicine. She mentions learning names in medical school but not who created those names or when. Her lesson is functional and practical, not historical.

While movement might maintain attention, that's not Dr. Welbody's stated purpose. She specifically directs students to feel specific bones: 'Can you feel the bone there?' This targeted approach is about learning bone locations, not general attention management. Attention is a side benefit, not the main goal. Focus on the educational objectives of each action.","Incorrect. The text doesn't suggest students are verifying picture accuracy—they're learning to locate bones they cannot see. The pictures show internal structures; the touching helps students connect those images to their own bodies. It's about making personal connections, not fact-checking. Dr. Welbody presents information as established facts, not theories to verify.","Correct! The text demonstrates this combination: Dr. Welbody shows pictures ('I have pictures on my computer to show you') AND has students touch bones ('rub the back of your neck. Can you feel the bone there?'). Pictures show what bones look like and where they are, but touching lets students experience their own skeletal structure. This transforms pictures from external information into personal, embodied knowledge. The text explicitly connects internal images to physical sensation.","Incorrect. While the text mentions that 'your skeletal system works with your muscular system,' the touching activities aren't designed as muscular exercise.

Review the order of activities from paragraphs 3-6.","Correct! The lesson follows a clear progression: First, Dr. Welbody teaches bone names and locations with guided touching ('Can you feel the bone there?'). Then she provides pictures for visual learning. Finally, the Simon Says game requires students to independently remember and locate bones ('Simon says, tap your skull!').

        Last time, we learned the names of some bones in the body. Today, let's learn more about bones! This is a human leg bone called the fibula. The fibula is one of the bones in your leg.

The outside part of a bone is very hard. It is made of the same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. This stuff is called calcium. Do you like milk? Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products. Exercise is also great for your bones.

---

If you could look inside a bone, you would see something called bone marrow. Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture. This picture shows bone marrow cells. You may already know about cells. If you look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that many things are made of tiny cells. Your skin is made of cells. Your bones are made of cells too.

Here you can see some bone marrow cells. There are millions of cells like these inside your bones. The bone marrow cells have a very important job. They work like little factories. They make red blood cells. Then, the red blood cells carry oxygen all around your body.

---

As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong way, bones can break.
This next picture shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture called an x-ray. X-rays help us see inside your body. Your bones are hard, so they show up well in x-ray pictures. The soft tissue around your bones is not as hard. That is why doctors like x-rays. We can take pictures of the inside of your body. We can use x-rays to find out if any bones are broken.

---

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast.
One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed. Then, I cut the cast off for him. He's just fine now.

        Last time, we learned the names of some bones in the body. Today, let's learn more about bones! This is a human leg bone called the fibula. The fibula is one of the bones in your leg.

The outside part of a bone is very hard. It is made of the same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. This stuff is called calcium. Do you like milk? Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products. Exercise is also great for your bones.

If you could look inside a bone, you would see something called bone marrow. Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture. This picture shows bone marrow cells. You may already know about cells. If you look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that many things are made of tiny cells. Your skin is made of cells. Your bones are made of cells too.

Here you can see some bone marrow cells. There are millions of cells like these inside your bones. The bone marrow cells have a very important job. They work like little factories. They make red blood cells. Then, the red blood cells carry oxygen all around your body.

---

As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong way, bones can break.
This next picture shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture called an x-ray. X-rays help us see inside your body. Your bones are hard, so they show up well in x-ray pictures. The soft tissue around your bones is not as hard. That is why doctors like x-rays. We can take pictures of the inside of your body. We can use x-rays to find out if any bones are broken.

---

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast.
One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed. Then, I cut the cast off for him. He's just fine now. His bone has healed and his arm is as good as new.",,,,,"In paragraph 2, what does the phrase 'work like little factories' tell you about bone marrow cells?",MCQ,They are very small in size.,They can be seen with microscopes.,They produce something important.,They are found inside bones.,C,"Incorrect.

Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products. Exercise is also great for your bones.

If you could look inside a bone, you would see something called bone marrow. Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture. This picture shows bone marrow cells. You may already know about cells. If you look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that many things are made of tiny cells. Your skin is made of cells. Your bones are made of cells too.

Here you can see some bone marrow cells. There are millions of cells like these inside your bones. The bone marrow cells have a very important job. They work like little factories. They make red blood cells. Then, the red blood cells carry oxygen all around your body.

As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong way, bones can break.
This next picture shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture called an x-ray. X-rays help us see inside your body. Your bones are hard, so they show up well in x-ray pictures. The soft tissue around your bones is not as hard. That is why doctors like x-rays. We can take pictures of the inside of your body. We can use x-rays to find out if any bones are broken.

---

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast.
One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed. Then, I cut the cast off for him. He's just fine now. His bone has healed and his arm is as good as new.",,,,,The sentence 'They can hold up a lot of weight' in paragraph 3 is included to show,MCQ,that bones are usually very strong and supportive.,how bones grow taller as children get older.,why bones sometimes break under pressure.,what happens when doctors set broken bones.,A,"Correct! This sentence emphasizes bone strength before introducing the concept of breaking. The passage states 'Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them... bones can break.' The sentence about holding weight demonstrates bones' normal strength and supportive function. The word 'But' that follows signals a contrast, showing this sentence establishes the positive characteristic before explaining the limitation.","Incorrect. Bone growth is mentioned in a different sentence: 'As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you.' The sentence about holding weight relates to bone STRENGTH, not growth or height increase. These are separate bone characteristics discussed in different sentences. Pay attention to which sentence addresses which bone property.","Incorrect. The sentence about holding weight actually shows bone STRENGTH, not weakness or breaking. The breaking explanation comes in the NEXT sentence: 'But if we put too much pressure on them... bones can break.' The 'but' signals a contrast - first establishing strength, THEN explaining limitations. The sentence in question establishes the positive capability, not the failure condition.","Incorrect. Setting broken bones is discussed later in paragraph 4 in the treatment section. The sentence about holding weight appears in paragraph 3's explanation of normal bone function and properties.

The phrase 'One way' indicates this is A way, not the ONLY way. The very next sentence confirms this: 'Exercise is also great for your bones,' providing another method.

This inference is confirmed when the passage immediately adds 'Exercise is also great for your bones,' explicitly providing a second method. When reading, pay attention to phrases like 'one way,' 'another,' 'also,' and 'in addition' - these signal multiple options or methods exist. The author chose 'one way' specifically to indicate this isn't the complete list of bone-healthy practices.","Incorrect. The sentence says dairy products are one way to help bones, but doesn't claim all healthy foods must contain dairy. Some healthy foods have dairy, others don't. The sentence specifically discusses dairy as 'one way' to care for bones, not as a requirement for all healthy eating. The author distinguishes 'healthy foods with dairy products' as a subset, not a universal rule.","Incorrect.

The author states 'Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture.'

The 'can't see inside' statement directly leads to the picture solution, not to hardness explanation.","Incorrect.

While bones DO grow back together, this happens over time (weeks or months), not immediately after setting. The setting creates the correct position, but healing is a gradual biological process that follows. The passage indicates the boy 'had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed,' showing healing occurs during cast-wearing, not immediately after setting.","Correct!

The passage establishes this prerequisite clearly: 'Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast... to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal.'

While waiting DOES occur during healing, it's not a prerequisite that must happen BEFORE healing begins - it happens WHILE healing occurs. The passage states the boy 'had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed,' using 'while' to show these happen simultaneously, not sequentially.

While the passage discusses both cells and treatment, it doesn't claim that cellular knowledge improves injury treatment. These topics are presented as separate educational points about bones - internal function (marrow) and injury management (breaks) - rather than showing one enables the other.

The passage is titled 'All About Bones' and systematically covers different aspects: composition (calcium), internal structure (marrow/cells), function (making blood cells), strength, breaking, and healing. The author connects these varied topics into comprehensive bone education. By covering both internal function AND injury/healing, the author provides a complete picture rather than just one aspect. This organizational structure helps readers understand bones holistically - what they're made of, what they do, and what happens when they're damaged.","Incorrect. The passage gives equal educational attention to different bone topics without suggesting hierarchy or ranking importance. Both bone marrow function and break treatment receive detailed explanations. The author presents multiple interesting bone facts, not an argument about which aspect matters most. Informational texts often cover various aspects of a topic without claiming one is more important than others.","Incorrect. The author's purpose isn't persuasion about ease of treatment.

The outside part of a bone is very hard. It is made of the same stuff as a seashell you might find at the beach. This stuff is called calcium. Do you like milk? Milk and other dairy foods like cheese have lots of calcium in them. They are very good for your bones. One way to take care of your bones is to eat healthy foods with dairy products. Exercise is also great for your bones.

If you could look inside a bone, you would see something called bone marrow. Since you can't see inside this bone, I'll show you a picture. This picture shows bone marrow cells. You may already know about cells. If you look at things with a strong microscope, you can see that many things are made of tiny cells. Your skin is made of cells. Your bones are made of cells too.

Here you can see some bone marrow cells. There are millions of cells like these inside your bones. The bone marrow cells have a very important job. They work like little factories. They make red blood cells. Then, the red blood cells carry oxygen all around your body.

---

As you get older and taller, your bones grow with you. Bones are very strong. They can hold up a lot of weight. But if we put too much pressure on them, or if the pressure comes from the wrong way, bones can break.
This next picture shows a broken bone. This is a special kind of picture called an x-ray. X-rays help us see inside your body. Your bones are hard, so they show up well in x-ray pictures. The soft tissue around your bones is not as hard. That is why doctors like x-rays. We can take pictures of the inside of your body. We can use x-rays to find out if any bones are broken.

---

Have any of you ever broken a bone? I fix lots of broken bones each year. First, I take x-rays to see if the bone is really broken. If the x-rays show that a bone is broken, then I set the bone. That means I put the bone pieces back in the right place. Once the bones are in the right place, I put on a cast.
One amazing thing about bones is that they can heal themselves. Once a broken bone has been set, it grows back just like it was before. Here's a boy I helped last summer. He broke one of the bones in his arm. I put the cast on to hold the bones in the right place so they would heal. He had to cope with wearing the cast for two months while the bones healed. Then, I cut the cast off for him. He's just fine now. His bone has healed and his arm is as good as new.",,,,,What causes bone marrow cells to be described as working 'like little factories'?,MCQ,They are made up of millions of tiny parts inside bones.,They need microscopes to be seen because they are small.,They create red blood cells that the body needs to function.,They are located in the inner part of bones where we can't see them.,C,"Incorrect. While bone marrow does consist of many cells, the factory comparison emphasizes what they DO (produce/manufacture), not how they're composed or how many there are. Factories are known for MAKING products, not for being made of many parts. The passage connects the factory metaphor to production: 'They work like little factories. They make red blood cells.' Focus on the action that follows the comparison.","Incorrect. The factory comparison relates to their FUNCTION (production), not their size or how we observe them. While small things do need microscopes, that's not what makes them factory-like. Factories are defined by their manufacturing/production role, not by being small or hard to see. The author chose 'factory' specifically to emphasize the manufacturing function, not observation challenges.","Correct! The passage directly connects the factory metaphor to production: 'They work like little factories. They make red blood cells.' Factories are places that manufacture or produce goods - the bone marrow cells are factory-like BECAUSE they manufacture red blood cells. This cause-effect relationship shows that their production function is what earns them the factory comparison. When analyzing figurative language, identify what characteristic the comparison emphasizes - here, it's the manufacturing/production capability.","Incorrect. Location inside bones doesn't explain the factory comparison. The passage mentions location ('inside your bones') separately from the factory metaphor. Factories aren't defined by being hidden or internal - they're defined by producing/manufacturing things. The author uses 'factory' to emphasize the production function, not the location. Different sentences in the passage address different aspects: location vs. function.",3,medium,RI.3.3,3,quiz_302227,2026-01-10T20:02:13.599007,Targets paragraph 2's cause for factory metaphor (production function) - differs from reference which asks what the metaphor TELLS you (the fact that they make cells).

        Have you ever watched a movie where skeletons chase people around? I saw a funny cartoon like that recently. Some kids were trying to solve a mystery, but they had big problems. Every time they looked for clues, a skeleton would jump out of a grave and run after them!
Well, as a doctor, I need to tell you something important. That's not very realistic at all! Bones cannot move by themselves. In fact, bones don't go anywhere without help from muscles. When I bend my arm, I use my muscle power. I make the muscles in my arm tight, and then the muscles move my bones and the rest of my arm. When you kick a soccer ball, it works the same way. You make the muscles in your legs tight to move your leg bones.

Our bodies have many muscles working together. This is called the muscular system. There are about 650 muscles in the human body! That's a lot of muscles. About half of what you weigh comes from your muscles. Pretty amazing, right?
Muscles are very important to us for many reasons. Can you think of some ways we use muscles? Muscles help us run fast and jump high. They let us stand up from a chair and sit back down. We use muscles when we lift heavy things like books or toys. We also use them when we chew our dinner and when we smile at our friends. We even use muscles when we breathe air into our lungs.

---

Doctors put muscles into two main groups. The first group is called voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control and make move when you want them to. The second group is called involuntary muscles. These are muscles that you cannot control at all. Involuntary muscles work automatically without you even thinking about them.
The muscles that help you move your arms and legs are voluntary muscles. When you want to pick up a heavy box, you think about it first. Then you make the muscles in your arms tight so you can lift the box up. You can also control the muscles in your legs when you want to make your body run around the playground or jump over a puddle.

But the muscles in your heart are involuntary muscles. They keep your heart beating all day and all night, whether you are awake or fast asleep. You don't have to remember to think, ""Time to beat again, heart!"" These muscles work automatically without any help from you. There are also involuntary muscles in your stomach.

        Have you ever watched a movie where skeletons chase people around? I saw a funny cartoon like that recently. Some kids were trying to solve a mystery, but they had big problems. Every time they looked for clues, a skeleton would jump out of a grave and run after them!
Well, as a doctor, I need to tell you something important. That's not very realistic at all! Bones cannot move by themselves. In fact, bones don't go anywhere without help from muscles. When I bend my arm, I use my muscle power. I make the muscles in my arm tight, and then the muscles move my bones and the rest of my arm. When you kick a soccer ball, it works the same way. You make the muscles in your legs tight to move your leg bones.

Our bodies have many muscles working together. This is called the muscular system. There are about 650 muscles in the human body! That's a lot of muscles. About half of what you weigh comes from your muscles. Pretty amazing, right?
Muscles are very important to us for many reasons. Can you think of some ways we use muscles? Muscles help us run fast and jump high. They let us stand up from a chair and sit back down. We use muscles when we lift heavy things like books or toys. We also use them when we chew our dinner and when we smile at our friends. We even use muscles when we breathe air into our lungs.

Well, as a doctor, I need to tell you something important. That's not very realistic at all! Bones cannot move by themselves. In fact, bones don't go anywhere without help from muscles. When I bend my arm, I use my muscle power. I make the muscles in my arm tight, and then the muscles move my bones and the rest of my arm. When you kick a soccer ball, it works the same way. You make the muscles in your legs tight to move your leg bones.

Our bodies have many muscles working together. This is called the muscular system. There are about 650 muscles in the human body! That's a lot of muscles. About half of what you weigh comes from your muscles. Pretty amazing, right?
Muscles are very important to us for many reasons. Can you think of some ways we use muscles? Muscles help us run fast and jump high. They let us stand up from a chair and sit back down. We use muscles when we lift heavy things like books or toys. We also use them when we chew our dinner and when we smile at our friends. We even use muscles when we breathe air into our lungs.

Doctors put muscles into two main groups. The first group is called voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control and make move when you want them to. The second group is called involuntary muscles. These are muscles that you cannot control at all. Involuntary muscles work automatically without you even thinking about them.
The muscles that help you move your arms and legs are voluntary muscles. When you want to pick up a heavy box, you think about it first. Then you make the muscles in your arms tight so you can lift the box up. You can also control the muscles in your legs when you want to make your body run around the playground or jump over a puddle.

She took her son and dipped him in the river. Then she felt better. She believed her son was invulnerable. This means nothing could harm him.
But there was one problem. When she dipped Achilles in the river, she held him by his heel. So his heel never got wet in the special river. Many years later, during the Trojan War, a Trojan warrior shot an arrow at Achilles. The arrow hit right above his heel—the very spot that had not been dipped in the River Styx.

She took her son and dipped him in the river. Then she felt better. She believed her son was invulnerable. This means nothing could harm him.
But there was one problem. When she dipped Achilles in the river, she held him by his heel. So his heel never got wet in the special river. Many years later, during the Trojan War, a Trojan warrior shot an arrow at Achilles. The arrow hit right above his heel—the very spot that had not been dipped in the River Styx.

Do you know what we call the place where two bones come together? It's called a joint. You have lots of joints in your body. Your elbow is a joint. So is your shoulder and your knee.Many joints are soft because of cartilage. Cartilage is a special kind of connective tissue. It is not as hard as bone, but it is stiffer than muscle. It is also flexible, which means it can bend. Do you remember learning about vertebrae? Those are the bones in your back. Well, we have cartilage between each of the thirty bones in our back. The cartilage works like a soft cushion. It keeps the bones from hitting each other.

        Your body has many different systems that work together. The skeletal system is made up of bones. The muscular system is made up of muscles. The nervous system is made up of nerves! You have about 200 bones in your body. You also have about 650 muscles to help you move those bones around. How many nerves do you think you have? You might guess a thousand or even ten thousand. But you actually have about a billion nerves in your body!
Your nerves are very important. They help you keep track of what's happening around you. The nerves send messages to your brain. Then your brain tells your body what to do. Have you ever walked outside and felt cold? Your body probably told you to go back inside and get a coat. What happened was the nerves in your skin sent a message to your brain. The message was ""It's cold out here!""

---

Have you ever touched something hot? You probably pulled your hand away very quickly. That happened because your nerves sent a message to your brain right away. Nerves are important for our sense of touch. Without nerves, we couldn't feel if things are hot or cold. We couldn't touch things and know if they are smooth or rough. Nerves are also important for all our other senses. Without nerves, we couldn't see or hear. We couldn't smell or taste our food either.
The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells. A single nerve has many nerve cells inside it. Nerve cells have long stringy parts that go out from the center. The center of the cell is called the cell body. The stringy parts that go away from the cell body are called dendrites. You can think of dendrites like roads. When a nerve wants to send a message to your brain, it sends the message along the dendrites. The message travels along the dendrites just like a car travels on a road.

---

Has your family doctor ever tapped you on the knee with a little rubber hammer? Did you wonder why the doctor did that? Your doctor was checking your reflexes. This is a way to check if your nerves are working well. A reflex is something your body does without you thinking about it. If someone jumps out and scares you, you might flinch. You will tighten up your muscles just in case someone is trying to hurt you. This is a reflex. When you pull your hand away from a hot stove, that is also a reflex.
When your doctor taps your knee with the hammer, he is looking for a reflex reaction. If your leg moves a little bit, that's a good sign. It means your nervous system is working the way it should. This simple test helps doctors make sure your nerves are healthy and doing their job properly.",,,,,What happens after your nerves send a message that you are cold?,MCQ,Your brain tells your body what to do.,Your muscles start to move your bones.,Your skin sends another message.,Your body counts all the nerves.,A,"Correct!

But you actually have about a billion nerves in your body!
Your nerves are very important. They help you keep track of what's happening around you. The nerves send messages to your brain. Then your brain tells your body what to do. Have you ever walked outside and felt cold? Your body probably told you to go back inside and get a coat. What happened was the nerves in your skin sent a message to your brain. The message was ""It's cold out here!""

Have you ever touched something hot? You probably pulled your hand away very quickly. That happened because your nerves sent a message to your brain right away. Nerves are important for our sense of touch. Without nerves, we couldn't feel if things are hot or cold. We couldn't touch things and know if they are smooth or rough. Nerves are also important for all our other senses. Without nerves, we couldn't see or hear. We couldn't smell or taste our food either.
The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells. A single nerve has many nerve cells inside it. Nerve cells have long stringy parts that go out from the center. The center of the cell is called the cell body. The stringy parts that go away from the cell body are called dendrites. You can think of dendrites like roads. When a nerve wants to send a message to your brain, it sends the message along the dendrites. The message travels along the dendrites just like a car travels on a road.

Has your family doctor ever tapped you on the knee with a little rubber hammer? Did you wonder why the doctor did that? Your doctor was checking your reflexes. This is a way to check if your nerves are working well. A reflex is something your body does without you thinking about it. If someone jumps out and scares you, you might flinch. You will tighten up your muscles just in case someone is trying to hurt you. This is a reflex. When you pull your hand away from a hot stove, that is also a reflex.

Has your family doctor ever tapped you on the knee with a little rubber hammer? Did you wonder why the doctor did that? Your doctor was checking your reflexes. This is a way to check if your nerves are working well. A reflex is something your body does without you thinking about it. If someone jumps out and scares you, you might flinch. You will tighten up your muscles just in case someone is trying to hurt you. This is a reflex. When you pull your hand away from a hot stove, that is also a reflex.
When your doctor taps your knee with the hammer, he is looking for a reflex reaction. If your leg moves a little bit, that's a good sign. It means your nervous system is working the way it should.

        Your body has many different systems that work together. The skeletal system is made up of bones. The muscular system is made up of muscles. The nervous system is made up of nerves! You have about 200 bones in your body. You also have about 650 muscles to help you move those bones around. How many nerves do you think you have? You might guess a thousand or even ten thousand. But you actually have about a billion nerves in your body!
Your nerves are very important. They help you keep track of what's happening around you. The nerves send messages to your brain. Then your brain tells your body what to do. Have you ever walked outside and felt cold? Your body probably told you to go back inside and get a coat. What happened was the nerves in your skin sent a message to your brain. The message was ""It's cold out here!""

Have you ever touched something hot? You probably pulled your hand away very quickly. That happened because your nerves sent a message to your brain right away. Nerves are important for our sense of touch. Without nerves, we couldn't feel if things are hot or cold. We couldn't touch things and know if they are smooth or rough. Nerves are also important for all our other senses. Without nerves, we couldn't see or hear. We couldn't smell or taste our food either.
The nerves in your body are made up of nerve cells. A single nerve has many nerve cells inside it. Nerve cells have long stringy parts that go out from the center. The center of the cell is called the cell body. The stringy parts that go away from the cell body are called dendrites. You can think of dendrites like roads. When a nerve wants to send a message to your brain, it sends the message along the dendrites. The message travels along the dendrites just like a car travels on a road.

This is a way to check if your nerves are working well. A reflex is something your body does without you thinking about it. If someone jumps out and scares you, you might flinch. You will tighten up your muscles just in case someone is trying to hurt you. This is a reflex. When you pull your hand away from a hot stove, that is also a reflex.
When your doctor taps your knee with the hammer, he is looking for a reflex reaction. If your leg moves a little bit, that's a good sign. It means your nervous system is working the way it should. This simple test helps doctors make sure your nerves are healthy and doing their job properly.",,,,,"Based on the entire passage, what does the author think is most important for readers to understand about nerves?",MCQ,that nerves are made up of cells with dendrites that look like roads,that nerves perform many essential functions throughout the entire body,that doctors can test your nerves by tapping your knee with a hammer,that the nervous system is one of three main systems in your body,B,"Incorrect. While the passage does explain nerve cell structure and the dendrite-road comparison, this is only one paragraph out of five. The author discusses many other aspects of nerves, suggesting that structure alone is not the most important point.","Correct! Throughout the passage, the author emphasizes multiple critical functions of nerves: sending messages to the brain (paragraph 2), enabling all five senses (paragraph 3), transmitting information through their structure (paragraph 4), and creating protective reflexes (paragraph 5). The breadth of coverage shows the author wants readers to understand that nerves are essential for many body functions.",Incorrect. The knee tap test is mentioned only in the final paragraph as one way doctors check nerve health. This is a small part of the passage compared to the extensive discussion of what nerves do and why they are important throughout the body.,"Incorrect. The three systems are mentioned only in the opening paragraph as background.

        You have lots of nerves! Really, you do! You have nerves in your fingers and toes. There are nerves all over your body. But two parts of your body are very important for your nervous system. One is the spinal cord. The other is the brain.
Your spinal cord is made up of long strings of nerves. These nerves run through the hollow parts of your spine bones. The spine bones protect your spinal cord. The nerves in your spinal cord go all the way up your back and neck. They connect to your brain.
If someone hurts their spinal cord badly, they might become paralyzed. This means they cannot move their arms or legs. They might need to use a wheelchair to get around. The brain uses the spinal cord like a highway to send messages to the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken, the messages cannot get through.

---

The spinal cord connects to the center of your nervous system - your brain. The brain gets messages from nerves all over your body. It also sends messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain weighs only 2-3 pounds, it is the most important organ for life.
Your skull protects your brain. Inside the skull, there are three layers of fiber and fluid that protect the brain even more. The brain is very well protected, but it can still get hurt. A football player who gets a concussion knows this. A concussion is like bruising the brain. Ouch!

---

The brain has three main parts. Each part has its own special job. The medulla is at the bottom of the brain where it meets the spinal cord. The medulla controls important things your body does without thinking, like breathing and heartbeat.
The cerebellum sits right next to the medulla. It is split into two parts called hemispheres. The cerebellum helps control movements you choose to make, like walking and jumping. The right hemisphere controls the left side of your body. The left hemisphere controls the right side of your body.
The cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It sits on top of the other parts. Different areas of the cerebrum do different jobs. The front part controls feelings. The back part controls sight. The outside layer of the cerebrum is called the cerebral cortex. This wrinkly part is what most people think of when they picture a brain.

For many years, scientists did not know much about what different parts of the brain do. But in the past few decades, they have learned a lot. A decade is ten years. Scientists now have special tools to look at the brain while it works. They use something called a PET scan to see the brain in action.
During a PET scan, a scientist might ask someone to talk or blink. When the person does these things, different parts of the brain light up on a computer screen. This helps scientists learn what happens in each part of the brain.

The cerebellum sits right next to the medulla. It is split into two parts called hemispheres. The cerebellum helps control movements you choose to make, like walking and jumping. The right hemisphere controls the left side of your body. The left hemisphere controls the right side of your body.
The cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It sits on top of the other parts. Different areas of the cerebrum do different jobs. The front part controls feelings. The back part controls sight. The outside layer of the cerebrum is called the cerebral cortex. This wrinkly part is what most people think of when they picture a brain.

For many years, scientists did not know much about what different parts of the brain do. But in the past few decades, they have learned a lot. A decade is ten years. Scientists now have special tools to look at the brain while it works. They use something called a PET scan to see the brain in action.
During a PET scan, a scientist might ask someone to talk or blink. When the person does these things, different parts of the brain light up on a computer screen.

        You have lots of nerves! Really, you do! You have nerves in your fingers and toes. There are nerves all over your body. But two parts of your body are very important for your nervous system. One is the spinal cord. The other is the brain.
Your spinal cord is made up of long strings of nerves. These nerves run through the hollow parts of your spine bones. The spine bones protect your spinal cord. The nerves in your spinal cord go all the way up your back and neck. They connect to your brain.
If someone hurts their spinal cord badly, they might become paralyzed. This means they cannot move their arms or legs. They might need to use a wheelchair to get around. The brain uses the spinal cord like a highway to send messages to the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken, the messages cannot get through.

---

The spinal cord connects to the center of your nervous system - your brain. The brain gets messages from nerves all over your body. It also sends messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain weighs only 2-3 pounds, it is the most important organ for life.
Your skull protects your brain. Inside the skull, there are three layers of fiber and fluid that protect the brain even more. The brain is very well protected, but it can still get hurt. A football player who gets a concussion knows this. A concussion is like bruising the brain. Ouch!

        You have lots of nerves! Really, you do! You have nerves in your fingers and toes. There are nerves all over your body. But two parts of your body are very important for your nervous system. One is the spinal cord. The other is the brain.
Your spinal cord is made up of long strings of nerves. These nerves run through the hollow parts of your spine bones. The spine bones protect your spinal cord. The nerves in your spinal cord go all the way up your back and neck. They connect to your brain.
If someone hurts their spinal cord badly, they might become paralyzed. This means they cannot move their arms or legs. They might need to use a wheelchair to get around. The brain uses the spinal cord like a highway to send messages to the rest of the body. If the spinal cord is broken, the messages cannot get through.

---

The spinal cord connects to the center of your nervous system - your brain. The brain gets messages from nerves all over your body. It also sends messages out to your muscles. Even though the brain weighs only 2-3 pounds, it is the most important organ for life.
Your skull protects your brain. Inside the skull, there are three layers of fiber and fluid that protect the brain even more. The brain is very well protected, but it can still get hurt. A football player who gets a concussion knows this. A concussion is like bruising the brain. Ouch!

---

The brain has three main parts. Each part has its own special job. The medulla is at the bottom of the brain where it meets the spinal cord. The medulla controls important things your body does without thinking, like breathing and heartbeat.
The cerebellum sits right next to the medulla. It is split into two parts called hemispheres. The cerebellum helps control movements you choose to make, like walking and jumping. The right hemisphere controls the left side of your body. The left hemisphere controls the right side of your body.
The cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It sits on top of the other parts. Different areas of the cerebrum do different jobs. The front part controls feelings. The back part controls sight. The outside layer of the cerebrum is called the cerebral cortex. This wrinkly part is what most people think of when they picture a brain.

---

For many years, scientists did not know much about what different parts of the brain do. But in the past few decades, they have learned a lot. A decade is ten years. Scientists now have special tools to look at the brain while it works. They use something called a PET scan to see the brain in action.
During a PET scan, a scientist might ask someone to talk or blink. When the person does these things, different parts of the brain light up on a computer screen. This helps scientists learn what happens in each part of the brain. They have discovered that some things we do happen in the left side of the brain, while other things happen in the right side.",,,,,"If scientists saw the back part of someone's cerebrum light up during a PET scan, what would that person most likely be doing?",MCQ,talking to a friend about their feelings,walking across the room quickly,looking at a picture on the wall,thinking about what to eat for lunch,C,"Incorrect.

        For the past few articles, we have been learning about the body and how it works. Today we will learn about vision, which means how we see things. We have a special guest to help us learn. His name is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. He is an optometrist. An optometrist is a special eye doctor who knows all about eyes and how they work.
Hello! I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn about your amazing eyes? Let's start with the parts you can see when you look at someone's face. The pupil is the black circle in the center of your eye. The iris is the colored part around the pupil. Your iris can be brown, green, blue, or other colors. When people say you have brown eyes, they are talking about your iris.

---

The pupil is always black, but it can change size. When it is dark outside, your pupil gets bigger to let more light into your eye. When it is very bright and sunny, your pupil gets smaller to let less light in. This helps protect your eye from too much light.
Now let's learn about the parts inside your eye that you cannot see. The cornea is like a clear window that covers the front of your eye. It helps keep dirt and germs out of your eye. The lens is inside your eye and helps focus light so you can see clearly. It is curved like the bottom of a spoon.

---

The retina is at the back of your eye. It is made of special tissue that is very sensitive to light. This means it can feel even small amounts of light. The retina has special cells called rods and cones. These rods and cones are like tiny messengers that sense light and send information to your brain.
All the information from your retina travels to your brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is like a highway that carries messages from your eye to your brain very quickly.

---

Here is how you see things. First, light comes into your eye through the cornea. Then it goes through the pupil. If it is dark, your pupil opens wide to let more light in. If it is bright, your pupil gets small to let less light in. Next, the light goes through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina.
The rods and cones in your retina sense the light and send messages through the optic nerve to your brain. Your brain puts together the messages from both eyes to make one clear picture. All of this happens so fast that it seems like you see things right away. But really, your brain needs a tiny moment to understand what you are looking at. That is how vision works!",,,,,What happens to the information from the retina after the rods and cones sense light?,MCQ,The information travels to the brain through the optic nerve,The information makes the pupil change size to adjust light,The information gets blocked by the lens and cornea,The information stays in the retina until you blink,A,Correct!

Hello! I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn about your amazing eyes? Let's start with the parts you can see when you look at someone's face. The pupil is the black circle in the center of your eye. The iris is the colored part around the pupil. Your iris can be brown, green, blue, or other colors. When people say you have brown eyes, they are talking about your iris.

---

The pupil is always black, but it can change size. When it is dark outside, your pupil gets bigger to let more light into your eye. When it is very bright and sunny, your pupil gets smaller to let less light in. This helps protect your eye from too much light.
Now let's learn about the parts inside your eye that you cannot see. The cornea is like a clear window that covers the front of your eye. It helps keep dirt and germs out of your eye. The lens is inside your eye and helps focus light so you can see clearly. It is curved like the bottom of a spoon.

---

The retina is at the back of your eye. It is made of special tissue that is very sensitive to light. This means it can feel even small amounts of light. The retina has special cells called rods and cones. These rods and cones are like tiny messengers that sense light and send information to your brain.
All the information from your retina travels to your brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is like a highway that carries messages from your eye to your brain very quickly.

---

Here is how you see things. First, light comes into your eye through the cornea. Then it goes through the pupil. If it is dark, your pupil opens wide to let more light in. If it is bright, your pupil gets small to let less light in. Next, the light goes through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina.
The rods and cones in your retina sense the light and send messages through the optic nerve to your brain. Your brain puts together the messages from both eyes to make one clear picture. All of this happens so fast that it seems like you see things right away. But really, your brain needs a tiny moment to understand what you are looking at. That is how vision works!",,,,,"Dr. Kwan's explanation that begins with 'The pupil is always black, but it can change size' helps readers understand",MCQ,which colors are possible for different people's irises,how the eye responds automatically to different lighting conditions,what causes some people to need glasses or contacts,why the cornea needs to stay clear like a window,B,"Incorrect.

        For the past few articles, we have been learning about the body and how it works. Today we will learn about vision, which means how we see things. We have a special guest to help us learn. His name is Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. He is an optometrist. An optometrist is a special eye doctor who knows all about eyes and how they work.
Hello! I am Dr. Kwan Si-Yu. Are you ready to learn about your amazing eyes? Let's start with the parts you can see when you look at someone's face. The pupil is the black circle in the center of your eye. The iris is the colored part around the pupil. Your iris can be brown, green, blue, or other colors. When people say you have brown eyes, they are talking about your iris.

---

The pupil is always black, but it can change size. When it is dark outside, your pupil gets bigger to let more light into your eye. When it is very bright and sunny, your pupil gets smaller to let less light in. This helps protect your eye from too much light.
Now let's learn about the parts inside your eye that you cannot see. The cornea is like a clear window that covers the front of your eye. It helps keep dirt and germs out of your eye. The lens is inside your eye and helps focus light so you can see clearly. It is curved like the bottom of a spoon.

---

The retina is at the back of your eye. It is made of special tissue that is very sensitive to light. This means it can feel even small amounts of light. The retina has special cells called rods and cones. These rods and cones are like tiny messengers that sense light and send information to your brain.
All the information from your retina travels to your brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is like a highway that carries messages from your eye to your brain very quickly.

---

Here is how you see things. First, light comes into your eye through the cornea. Then it goes through the pupil. If it is dark, your pupil opens wide to let more light in. If it is bright, your pupil gets small to let less light in. Next, the light goes through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina.
The rods and cones in your retina sense the light and send messages through the optic nerve to your brain. Your brain puts together the messages from both eyes to make one clear picture. All of this happens so fast that it seems like you see things right away. But really, your brain needs a tiny moment to understand what you are looking at. That is how vision works!",,,,,The author's view about vision differs from a reader who thinks 'the pupil does all the work' because the author shows,MCQ,the pupil is actually the least important part of seeing,many different structures each contribute to the vision process,only the brain matters since it creates the final picture,the retina and optic nerve are more powerful than the pupil,B,"Incorrect. The author doesn't claim the pupil is 'least important' - it plays a role in controlling light. Rather than ranking parts, the author emphasizes how 'all the information' travels through multiple structures, showing each part contributes to the complete process.","Correct! The passage systematically describes cornea, pupil, lens, retina with rods and cones, optic nerve, and brain - showing how each has a specific function. The phrase 'All of this happens' and the sequential explanation demonstrate the author's view that vision requires multiple parts working together, not just the pupil alone.","Incorrect. While the brain processes the final picture, the author explains that without the eye parts (cornea letting light in, lens focusing, retina sensing, optic nerve transmitting), the brain would have nothing to process. The author shows all parts matter, not just the brain.","Incorrect. The author doesn't rank parts as more or less 'powerful.' Instead, the passage describes a coordinated sequence where each structure has its role. The author's point is collaborative function across multiple parts, not superiority of some over others.",3,medium,RI.3.6,3,quiz_302267,2026-01-10T20:16:35.415749,Targets reader misconception vs author's view about distributed function - differs from reference which asks about main explanatory focus without contrasting viewpoints,,all choices describe relationships between eye parts and their importance,all choices make claims about part importance or contribution,"A: 11 words, B: 10 words, C: 11 words, D: 11 words - within 9% range",each represents distinct views on part importance and relationships,only B captures author's emphasis on distributed contributions vs single-part misconception,targets contrasting viewpoints about distributed vs single-part function - uses comparison framework vs reference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        Last time, we learned about the parts of the eye and how they work together to help us see. Today, we will talk about vision problems and ways to fix them.
Many vision problems happen because of the lens in our eye. The lens is curved and bends light rays so they focus on the retina. When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and lens. These parts bend the light rays so they meet at the same spot on the retina. This gives us perfect vision.

---

Sometimes the cornea is not shaped the right way. When this happens, vision is not perfect. The light rays meet before they touch the retina. Then they hit different places on the retina. This makes a person nearsighted. A nearsighted person can see things that are close, but things far away look blurry.
There is also another vision problem called being farsighted. A farsighted person can see things far away clearly, but things up close look blurry. Both of these problems can be fixed in different ways.

---

Long ago, there was no way to help people with vision problems. Today, we have many ways to help. An optometrist can check and measure the lenses in your eyes. If they are not shaped correctly, the optometrist writes a prescription. This tells an optician what kind of special lenses to make. The optician then makes glasses with these special lenses.
Glasses work by placing a special lens in front of the eye. This lens bends the light in a different way before it enters the eye. When the light rays pass through the eye's cornea and lens, they now meet at the right spot on the retina. This fixes the vision problem.

---

Some people wear a contact lens instead of glasses. Contact lenses work the same way as glasses. The difference is that you insert the lens right into your eye. It sits on top of the cornea and covers the iris and pupil. Contact lenses are almost invisible when you wear them.
There is another way to fix vision problems called LASIK surgery. During this surgery, a doctor uses a laser beam to change the shape of the cornea. The laser beam is a special kind of light that can cut very carefully. Once the cornea is fixed with the laser, a person may not need glasses or contact lenses anymore.",,,,,"Based on Section 2, what does the word farsighted mean?",MCQ,can see things that are close clearly,can see things far away clearly,cannot see anything at all,can see everything perfectly,B,"This is incorrect.

        Last time, we learned about the parts of the eye and how they work together to help us see. Today, we will talk about vision problems and ways to fix them.
Many vision problems happen because of the lens in our eye. The lens is curved and bends light rays so they focus on the retina. When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and lens. These parts bend the light rays so they meet at the same spot on the retina. This gives us perfect vision.

---

Sometimes the cornea is not shaped the right way. When this happens, vision is not perfect. The light rays meet before they touch the retina. Then they hit different places on the retina. This makes a person nearsighted. A nearsighted person can see things that are close, but things far away look blurry.
There is also another vision problem called being farsighted. A farsighted person can see things far away clearly, but things up close look blurry. Both of these problems can be fixed in different ways.

---

Long ago, there was no way to help people with vision problems. Today, we have many ways to help. An optometrist can check and measure the lenses in your eyes. If they are not shaped correctly, the optometrist writes a prescription. This tells an optician what kind of special lenses to make. The optician then makes glasses with these special lenses.
Glasses work by placing a special lens in front of the eye. This lens bends the light in a different way before it enters the eye. When the light rays pass through the eye's cornea and lens, they now meet at the right spot on the retina. This fixes the vision problem.

Some people wear a contact lens instead of glasses. Contact lenses work the same way as glasses. The difference is that you insert the lens right into your eye. It sits on top of the cornea and covers the iris and pupil. Contact lenses are almost invisible when you wear them.
There is another way to fix vision problems called LASIK surgery. During this surgery, a doctor uses a laser beam to change the shape of the cornea. The laser beam is a special kind of light that can cut very carefully.

Some people wear a contact lens instead of glasses. Contact lenses work the same way as glasses. The difference is that you insert the lens right into your eye. It sits on top of the cornea and covers the iris and pupil. Contact lenses are almost invisible when you wear them.
There is another way to fix vision problems called LASIK surgery. During this surgery, a doctor uses a laser beam to change the shape of the cornea. The laser beam is a special kind of light that can cut very carefully. Once the cornea is fixed with the laser, a person may not need glasses or contact lenses anymore.",,,,,"According to the passage, what is the key difference between LASIK surgery and the other vision correction methods described?",MCQ,LASIK is performed by optometrists while other methods require opticians,LASIK permanently changes the eye itself while others use external lenses,LASIK can only fix nearsightedness while others fix all vision problems,LASIK requires a prescription while glasses and contacts do not,B,"This is incorrect. Section 4 states that 'a doctor' performs LASIK surgery, not an optometrist. Also, this doesn't address the key difference in how LASIK works compared to glasses and contacts. Focus on what makes LASIK fundamentally different as a solution.","This is correct! Section 4 explains that LASIK 'uses a laser beam to change the shape of the cornea' permanently, meaning 'a person may not need glasses or contact lenses anymore.' In contrast, Sections 3-4 show glasses and contacts use external lenses that must be worn, not permanent changes to the eye.",This is incorrect. The passage never states that LASIK can only fix one type of vision problem or that other methods fix all types. Section 4 presents LASIK as an alternative method without limiting what problems it can address. Reread to identify the actual key difference.,This is incorrect. Section 3 clearly explains that glasses require a prescription written by an optometrist. The passage doesn't suggest that LASIK requires a prescription while other methods don't.

        Today you will learn about hearing and how your ears work! Dr. Kim Audit is here to teach us. She is a doctor who knows all about ears. She brought a drum to help us understand sound.
""Hello everyone! Can you hear me? Great! Your ears help you every day. They pick up sounds at school and keep you safe on the playground. Let me show you how sound works with this drum,"" says Dr. Audit.
The drum has a thin membrane stretched over a wooden frame. When Dr. Audit hits the drum, the membrane starts to vibrate. This means it moves back and forth very fast. The vibrations make sound waves in the air. These sound waves travel to your ears so you can hear the drum!

---

Your ear has three main parts. The outer ear is the part you can see on the side of your head. It is made of soft tissue and has a special shape. This shape helps catch sounds and guide them inside your ear.
The outer ear has an opening called the ear canal. This is like a tunnel that goes into your head. The ear canal has tiny hairs and special glands that make ear wax. The ear wax helps protect your ear and keeps germs away. At the end of the ear canal is your eardrum. The eardrum is just like Dr. Audit's drum. It has a thin membrane that moves when sound waves hit it.

---

Behind your eardrum is the middle ear. This part has three very small bones with funny names. They are called the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. These bones got their names because of what they look like. The stirrup is the smallest bone in your whole body! It is only as big as a grain of sand.
When your eardrum vibrates, it makes these three tiny bones vibrate too. The bones pass the vibrations to the inner ear. The inner ear has a special part called the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail shell in a spiral coil. It is filled with fluid and lined with tiny hairs.

---

When sound waves reach the cochlea, they make the tiny hairs inside vibrate. These hairs are connected to nerves. The nerves send messages through the auditory nerve straight to your brain. Your brain understands these messages as sounds!
This whole process happens very fast. When Dr. Audit hits her drum, the sound waves travel across the room. They go through your outer ear, down your ear canal, and make your eardrum vibrate. Then the three small bones in your middle ear vibrate. Finally, the hairs in your cochlea vibrate and send messages to your brain.

The drum has a thin membrane stretched over a wooden frame. When Dr. Audit hits the drum, the membrane starts to vibrate. This means it moves back and forth very fast. The vibrations make sound waves in the air. These sound waves travel to your ears so you can hear the drum!

---

Your ear has three main parts. The outer ear is the part you can see on the side of your head. It is made of soft tissue and has a special shape. This shape helps catch sounds and guide them inside your ear.
The outer ear has an opening called the ear canal. This is like a tunnel that goes into your head. The ear canal has tiny hairs and special glands that make ear wax. The ear wax helps protect your ear and keeps germs away. At the end of the ear canal is your eardrum. The eardrum is just like Dr. Audit's drum. It has a thin membrane that moves when sound waves hit it.

---

Behind your eardrum is the middle ear. This part has three very small bones with funny names. They are called the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. These bones got their names because of what they look like. The stirrup is the smallest bone in your whole body! It is only as big as a grain of sand.
When your eardrum vibrates, it makes these three tiny bones vibrate too. The bones pass the vibrations to the inner ear. The inner ear has a special part called the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail shell in a spiral coil. It is filled with fluid and lined with tiny hairs.

---

When sound waves reach the cochlea, they make the tiny hairs inside vibrate. These hairs are connected to nerves. The nerves send messages through the auditory nerve straight to your brain. Your brain understands these messages as sounds!
This whole process happens very fast. When Dr. Audit hits her drum, the sound waves travel across the room. They go through your outer ear, down your ear canal, and make your eardrum vibrate. Then the three small bones in your middle ear vibrate. Finally, the hairs in your cochlea vibrate and send messages to your brain. All of this happens faster than you can blink your eyes!",,,,,A reader wants to know where to find details about the smallest bone in the human body.

        Today you will learn about hearing and how your ears work! Dr. Kim Audit is here to teach us. She is a doctor who knows all about ears. She brought a drum to help us understand sound.
""Hello everyone! Can you hear me? Great! Your ears help you every day. They pick up sounds at school and keep you safe on the playground. Let me show you how sound works with this drum,"" says Dr. Audit.
The drum has a thin membrane stretched over a wooden frame. When Dr. Audit hits the drum, the membrane starts to vibrate. This means it moves back and forth very fast. The vibrations make sound waves in the air. These sound waves travel to your ears so you can hear the drum!

---

Your ear has three main parts. The outer ear is the part you can see on the side of your head. It is made of soft tissue and has a special shape. This shape helps catch sounds and guide them inside your ear.
The outer ear has an opening called the ear canal. This is like a tunnel that goes into your head. The ear canal has tiny hairs and special glands that make ear wax. The ear wax helps protect your ear and keeps germs away. At the end of the ear canal is your eardrum. The eardrum is just like Dr. Audit's drum. It has a thin membrane that moves when sound waves hit it.

---

Behind your eardrum is the middle ear. This part has three very small bones with funny names. They are called the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup. These bones got their names because of what they look like. The stirrup is the smallest bone in your whole body! It is only as big as a grain of sand.
When your eardrum vibrates, it makes these three tiny bones vibrate too. The bones pass the vibrations to the inner ear. The inner ear has a special part called the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail shell in a spiral coil. It is filled with fluid and lined with tiny hairs.

---

When sound waves reach the cochlea, they make the tiny hairs inside vibrate. These hairs are connected to nerves. The nerves send messages through the auditory nerve straight to your brain. Your brain understands these messages as sounds!
This whole process happens very fast. When Dr. Audit hits her drum, the sound waves travel across the room. They go through your outer ear, down your ear canal, and make your eardrum vibrate. Then the three small bones in your middle ear vibrate. Finally, the hairs in your cochlea vibrate and send messages to your brain. All of this happens faster than you can blink your eyes!",,,,,Why does the author include the detail that 'the stirrup is only as big as a grain of sand' in Section 3?,MCQ,to explain why the stirrup bone is hard to study,to help readers understand the tiny size of the bone,to show that sand and bones are made of similar materials,to teach readers about different types of grains,B,Incorrect. The author's purpose isn't to discuss research difficulty but to illustrate size. Think about why authors compare unfamiliar objects to familiar ones when teaching young readers.,"Correct! After stating the stirrup is the smallest bone in the body, the author adds this comparison to a grain of sand - something third graders know is very tiny - to help them truly grasp just how incredibly small this bone is. This makes abstract information concrete and relatable. You correctly identified the author's purpose for including this vivid comparison.",Incorrect. The author isn't claiming sand and bones are similar materials - the grain of sand is used as a size comparison only. Focus on what aspect the comparison highlights.,"Incorrect. This passage teaches about hearing, not grains. The sand grain is mentioned only to help readers visualize the bone's size.

        People with disabilities face extra challenges in life. But these challenges don't stop people who are determined to do great things. Ray Charles was a famous musician who went blind when he was seven years old. He could not see, but his ears worked perfectly. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became one of the most popular musicians of his time.
Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his disability hold him back. His story shows that people can overcome difficulties with hard work and determination.

---

Helen Keller was another amazing person who overcame disabilities. She lost both her sight and hearing from a serious illness when she was just nineteen months old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life. As a young girl, Helen could not hear or speak. She learned to share a few ideas by making hand movements. When she wanted her mother, she would grab and pull her mother close. When she wanted to be alone, she would push her mom away.
There were only a few ideas she could share this way. There were many things she could not get across with hand movements. As a child, she would often try to talk to people and fail. Then she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted more than anything to talk with people, but she was not able to do so.

---

Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand words. But how can you understand words if you can't hear them? Sullivan started by giving Helen a doll to hold. Then she took Helen by the hand and traced the letters d-o-l-l on her palm. She did this over and over. After a while, Helen learned to write the letters d-o-l-l on a page. She did not know that she had written a word. She did not even know that words exist. But she felt proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.
Her teacher traced more words on Helen's palm. She learned to spell pin, hat, cup, and other words. The real breakthrough happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word water. Sullivan took Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen's hands under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen's head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful, cool something that was flowing over her hand.

---

Helen soon learned more words. When she was eight, she went to a special school for the blind. Sullivan went with her. Later, she went to a school for the deaf. But she didn't stop there. She went on to Radcliffe College, where she became the first deaf and blind person to receive a college degree.
Helen learned to speak and read lips with her fingers. She learned to read using Braille. She wrote books, including a story of her own life called The Story of My Life. She was active in politics and fought for women to have the right to vote. Helen Keller lived a long and productive life. She died in 1968 at the age of 87. In 2003, the state of Alabama honored Helen Keller by putting her picture on their state quarter.

Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand words. But how can you understand words if you can't hear them? Sullivan started by giving Helen a doll to hold. Then she took Helen by the hand and traced the letters d-o-l-l on her palm. She did this over and over. After a while, Helen learned to write the letters d-o-l-l on a page. She did not know that she had written a word. She did not even know that words exist. But she felt proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.
Her teacher traced more words on Helen's palm. She learned to spell pin, hat, cup, and other words. The real breakthrough happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word water. Sullivan took Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen's hands under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen's head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful, cool something that was flowing over her hand.

        People with disabilities face extra challenges in life. But these challenges don't stop people who are determined to do great things. Ray Charles was a famous musician who went blind when he was seven years old. He could not see, but his ears worked perfectly. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became one of the most popular musicians of his time.
Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his disability hold him back. His story shows that people can overcome difficulties with hard work and determination.

Helen Keller was another amazing person who overcame disabilities. She lost both her sight and hearing from a serious illness when she was just nineteen months old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life. As a young girl, Helen could not hear or speak. She learned to share a few ideas by making hand movements. When she wanted her mother, she would grab and pull her mother close. When she wanted to be alone, she would push her mom away.
There were only a few ideas she could share this way. There were many things she could not get across with hand movements. As a child, she would often try to talk to people and fail. Then she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted more than anything to talk with people, but she was not able to do so.

        People with disabilities face extra challenges in life. But these challenges don't stop people who are determined to do great things. Ray Charles was a famous musician who went blind when he was seven years old. He could not see, but his ears worked perfectly. He loved music and decided to become a musician. He learned to sing and play the piano. Eventually, he became one of the most popular musicians of his time.
Ray Charles won ten Grammy Awards and made millions of dollars as a singer. He did not let his disability hold him back. His story shows that people can overcome difficulties with hard work and determination.

---

Helen Keller was another amazing person who overcame disabilities. She lost both her sight and hearing from a serious illness when she was just nineteen months old. She was deaf and blind for the rest of her life. As a young girl, Helen could not hear or speak. She learned to share a few ideas by making hand movements. When she wanted her mother, she would grab and pull her mother close. When she wanted to be alone, she would push her mom away.
There were only a few ideas she could share this way. There were many things she could not get across with hand movements. As a child, she would often try to talk to people and fail. Then she would get angry and cry. Sometimes she would have terrible temper tantrums. She wanted more than anything to talk with people, but she was not able to do so.

Annie Sullivan wanted to teach Helen to understand words. But how can you understand words if you can't hear them? Sullivan started by giving Helen a doll to hold. Then she took Helen by the hand and traced the letters d-o-l-l on her palm. She did this over and over. After a while, Helen learned to write the letters d-o-l-l on a page. She did not know that she had written a word. She did not even know that words exist. But she felt proud that she could imitate what her teacher was doing.
Her teacher traced more words on Helen's palm. She learned to spell pin, hat, cup, and other words. The real breakthrough happened when Annie tried to teach Helen the word water. Sullivan took Helen outside to a well. She placed one of Helen's hands under the spout and spelled w-a-t-e-r on her other palm. Suddenly, something seemed to click in Helen's head. She understood that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful, cool something that was flowing over her hand.

        ""This is Rome,"" said Mrs. Teachwell, pointing to a black dot on the classroom map. ""But this is Rome too,"" she added. She traced a big circle that seemed to touch all four sides of the map.
The students looked confused.

""I'll explain,"" Mrs. Teachwell said, ""but please raise your hand if you would like to speak.""
Charlie Chatter nodded. It was not the first time he had heard this. In fact, Mrs. Teachwell had asked him to raise his hand many times. But it was hard for Charlie. His mouth seemed to be faster than his hand.

""Like Egypt on the Nile?"" Charlie asked.

It sprang up here, on the banks of the Tiber River, among seven hills. At first, Rome was just a few houses on a hill. Then, it grew and grew and grew. After a while, people started building houses on other hills nearby. Then, the little towns on the hills grew together to make a big city. In fact, to this day, Rome is known as the 'City of Seven Hills'.""
""Then, the Romans fought wars with their neighbors. The Romans won most of these wars. They defeated the Etruscans, who lived north of them. They conquered the Greeks, who had settled to the south, as well. It wasn't long before they controlled most of this piece of land that we call Italy.""

""Yes,"" said Mrs. Teachwell. ""Italy does look like a boot, but please, Charlie, raise your hand! This is your last warning. Now, does anyone know what this body of water that the boot of Italy sticks out into is called?""
Rachel Readmuch, who always had her nose in a book, raised her hand. Mrs. Teachwell called on her.
""It's called the Mediterranean,"" said Rachel.
""That's right!"" said Mrs. Teachwell. ""This is the Mediterranean Sea. Rome grew so much that, at its peak, the Romans controlled all the land around the Mediterranean Sea.

Tim Timetable, who loved to learn about when things happened, put up his hand. ""When was all this happening?""
""Rome started growing about two thousand five hundred years ago,"" Mrs. Teachwell explained. ""It started growing about five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, in the years we call BC or BCE. It was still growing when Jesus was born. In fact, Jesus was born here, in a part of the Middle East that was controlled by the Romans.""

""As Charlie has just reminded us,"" Mrs. Teachwell said, ""many civilizations spring up along the banks of a river. Rome was no different. It sprang up here, on the banks of the Tiber River, among seven hills. At first, Rome was just a few houses on a hill. Then, it grew and grew and grew. After a while, people started building houses on other hills nearby. Then, the little towns on the hills grew together to make a big city. In fact, to this day, Rome is known as the 'City of Seven Hills'.""
""Then, the Romans fought wars with their neighbors. The Romans won most of these wars. They defeated the Etruscans, who lived north of them. They conquered the Greeks, who had settled to the south, as well. It wasn't long before they controlled most of this piece of land that we call Italy.""

Rachel Readmuch, who always had her nose in a book, raised her hand. Mrs. Teachwell called on her.
""It's called the Mediterranean,"" said Rachel.
""That's right!"" said Mrs. Teachwell. ""This is the Mediterranean Sea. Rome grew so much that, at its peak, the Romans controlled all the land around the Mediterranean Sea.

Tim Timetable, who loved to learn about when things happened, put up his hand. ""When was all this happening?""

        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

---

The servant found the twins, but he could not bring himself to drown them. Instead, he put the boys in a basket and set it in the river. The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

---

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill. Each knew that it would be important to have a strong wall to protect his city.
After a few days, Remus decided to visit Romulus to see how his city was coming along. He decided to taunt his brother and make fun of his unfinished wall. To taunt means to make fun of someone in a mean way. ""You call that a wall?"" he said. ""That wall would not keep anyone out!"" Then he stepped over the wall to prove his point.

---

That made Romulus very angry. The brothers started to fight with all their might. Suddenly, Remus began to collapse. To collapse means to fall down suddenly. Remus fell to the ground and died. When Romulus saw what he had done, he began to cry. He had not wished to kill his brother.
Romulus went on building his city. He named it Rome after himself. Rome grew and grew until it became a great city at the center of a mighty empire.

        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

---

The servant found the twins, but he could not bring himself to drown them. Instead, he put the boys in a basket and set it in the river. The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

---

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill. Each knew that it would be important to have a strong wall to protect his city.
After a few days, Remus decided to visit Romulus to see how his city was coming along. He decided to taunt his brother and make fun of his unfinished wall. To taunt means to make fun of someone in a mean way. ""You call that a wall?"" he said. ""That wall would not keep anyone out!"" Then he stepped over the wall to prove his point.

---

That made Romulus very angry. The brothers started to fight with all their might. Suddenly, Remus began to collapse. To collapse means to fall down suddenly. Remus fell to the ground and died. When Romulus saw what he had done, he began to cry. He had not wished to kill his brother.
Romulus went on building his city. He named it Rome after himself. Rome grew and grew until it became a great city at the center of a mighty empire.

        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

---

The servant found the twins, but he could not bring himself to drown them. Instead, he put the boys in a basket and set it in the river. The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill.

        We learned that Rome started as a small town and grew to become a big city. Then it became a great empire. That's what historians tell us. A historian is a person who studies the past and writes about it. The Romans themselves have a special story about how their city got started. They say that Rome was founded by twins who had been saved by a wolf. The twins were named Romulus and Remus.
The twins were the children of a woman named Rhea Silvia and the god Mars. Their mother loved them, but her brother did not. He was the king of Latium. He saw the boys as a threat. A threat is something that could cause danger or harm. The king thought they might grow up and take his crown from him. He told one of his servants to find the twins and drown them in the Tiber River.

---

The servant found the twins, but he could not bring himself to drown them. Instead, he put the boys in a basket and set it in the river. The basket floated downstream until it washed up on the banks of the river. A she-wolf found the twins. A she-wolf is a female wolf. She saw that they were hungry and took them to her cave. There she gave them the same milk she fed to her wolf pups. Later, the twins were adopted by a shepherd who raised them well. They grew up to be smart and strong.

---

When they were 18, Romulus and Remus decided to create a city of their own. They wanted to build it on the banks of the Tiber River, somewhere among the seven hills. Soon, however, the brothers began to fight about where to build it. Each brother started building his own city on a different hill. Each knew that it would be important to have a strong wall to protect his city.
After a few days, Remus decided to visit Romulus to see how his city was coming along. He decided to taunt his brother and make fun of his unfinished wall. To taunt means to make fun of someone in a mean way. ""You call that a wall?"" he said. ""That wall would not keep anyone out!"" Then he stepped over the wall to prove his point.

---

That made Romulus very angry. The brothers started to fight with all their might. Suddenly, Remus began to collapse. To collapse means to fall down suddenly. Remus fell to the ground and died. When Romulus saw what he had done, he began to cry. He had not wished to kill his brother.
Romulus went on building his city. He named it Rome after himself. Rome grew and grew until it became a great city at the center of a mighty empire.

        Let's learn about the gods and goddesses of Rome. The ancient Romans did not believe in one God who ruled the entire world. They believed in many gods. In many ways, the Roman gods acted like people. They ate and drank. They played tricks on each other. They fell in love and got into fights. But there was one main way the gods were different from people: the gods were immortal. People might live for many years. Some might even live to be one hundred. But they would die someday. The gods lived forever. They could not die.
The Romans' ideas about their gods were like the ancient Greeks. They worshipped many of the same gods as the Greeks. But they called those gods by different names.

---

The top god was sometimes called the father of the immortal gods. He was a strong, bearded figure. The Greeks called him Zeus. The Romans called him Jupiter. Jupiter was a mighty god. He carried a thunderbolt that he could throw at anyone who made him angry. If Jupiter threw his thunderbolt at you, that was the end of you. Jupiter lived on Mount Olympus with the other gods.
Juno was Jupiter's wife. She was the goddess of marriage and the protector of wives. The Roman gods were all related. They were like a big family. Jupiter's brother Neptune was the god of the seas and oceans.
There are many statues of Neptune. In most of them, he is holding a special three-pointed spear called a trident. Neptune's trident had magical powers. The god could use it to stir up storms and waves. He could also wave it over the stormy seas and make the rough seas smooth.

---

Roman sailors prayed to Neptune. ""Great Neptune!"" they prayed. ""Send us good weather and smooth sailing!"" Mars was the god of war. Soldiers would pray to him before a big battle. The Romans fought many wars, so they spent lots of time praying to Mars.
Mercury was one of Jupiter and Juno's sons. He was the messenger of the gods. He was as fast as lightning. In paintings, he is often shown with wings on his hat and shoes to show how fast he was.
Venus was the goddess of love. She was very beautiful. If Venus wanted someone to fall in love, she could send her son Cupid on a mission. Cupid would shoot the person with one of his magic arrows. The person would then fall in love with the first person they saw. Cupid is still with us today. You will see little Cupids everywhere on Valentine's Day, when we celebrate love.

Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune are the names of planets in our solar system. These planets are named after the Roman gods.

        Let's learn about the gods and goddesses of Rome. The ancient Romans did not believe in one God who ruled the entire world. They believed in many gods. In many ways, the Roman gods acted like people. They ate and drank. They played tricks on each other. They fell in love and got into fights. But there was one main way the gods were different from people: the gods were immortal. People might live for many years. Some might even live to be one hundred. But they would die someday. The gods lived forever. They could not die.
The Romans' ideas about their gods were like the ancient Greeks. They worshipped many of the same gods as the Greeks. But they called those gods by different names.

---

The top god was sometimes called the father of the immortal gods. He was a strong, bearded figure. The Greeks called him Zeus. The Romans called him Jupiter. Jupiter was a mighty god. He carried a thunderbolt that he could throw at anyone who made him angry. If Jupiter threw his thunderbolt at you, that was the end of you. Jupiter lived on Mount Olympus with the other gods.
Juno was Jupiter's wife. She was the goddess of marriage and the protector of wives. The Roman gods were all related. They were like a big family. Jupiter's brother Neptune was the god of the seas and oceans.
There are many statues of Neptune. In most of them, he is holding a special three-pointed spear called a trident. Neptune's trident had magical powers. The god could use it to stir up storms and waves. He could also wave it over the stormy seas and make the rough seas smooth.

---

Roman sailors prayed to Neptune. ""Great Neptune!"" they prayed. ""Send us good weather and smooth sailing!"" Mars was the god of war. Soldiers would pray to him before a big battle. The Romans fought many wars, so they spent lots of time praying to Mars.
Mercury was one of Jupiter and Juno's sons. He was the messenger of the gods. He was as fast as lightning. In paintings, he is often shown with wings on his hat and shoes to show how fast he was.
Venus was the goddess of love. She was very beautiful. If Venus wanted someone to fall in love, she could send her son Cupid on a mission. Cupid would shoot the person with one of his magic arrows.

        Let's learn about the gods and goddesses of Rome. The ancient Romans did not believe in one God who ruled the entire world. They believed in many gods. In many ways, the Roman gods acted like people. They ate and drank. They played tricks on each other. They fell in love and got into fights. But there was one main way the gods were different from people: the gods were immortal. People might live for many years. Some might even live to be one hundred. But they would die someday. The gods lived forever. They could not die.
The Romans' ideas about their gods were like the ancient Greeks. They worshipped many of the same gods as the Greeks. But they called those gods by different names.

---

The top god was sometimes called the father of the immortal gods. He was a strong, bearded figure. The Greeks called him Zeus. The Romans called him Jupiter. Jupiter was a mighty god. He carried a thunderbolt that he could throw at anyone who made him angry. If Jupiter threw his thunderbolt at you, that was the end of you. Jupiter lived on Mount Olympus with the other gods.
Juno was Jupiter's wife. She was the goddess of marriage and the protector of wives. The Roman gods were all related. They were like a big family. Jupiter's brother Neptune was the god of the seas and oceans.
There are many statues of Neptune. In most of them, he is holding a special three-pointed spear called a trident. Neptune's trident had magical powers. The god could use it to stir up storms and waves. He could also wave it over the stormy seas and make the rough seas smooth.

        Good morning, class! Last time we learned about some of the Roman gods and goddesses. Today, I'd like to tell you about a few more important gods and goddesses that the Romans worshipped.
Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. A blacksmith is someone who works with hot metal to make things. Vulcan would heat up iron and other metals until they were very hot. Then he would hammer and shape the metal to make swords, helmets, and shields for the other gods. Vulcan was also the god of fire and volcanoes. A volcano is a mountain that can shoot out hot melted rock and fire. The Romans believed that when a volcano erupted, it was because Vulcan was working hard in his workshop deep inside the earth.

---

Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and poetry. Both the Greeks and the Romans worshipped Apollo. He had a famous shrine at a place called Delphi in Greece. A shrine is a special holy place where people go to pray and worship their gods. When the Greeks and Romans needed advice about important decisions, they would send messengers to Apollo's shrine at Delphi. There, a priestess would speak for Apollo and give them answers. A priestess is a woman who serves a god or goddess in religious ceremonies. However, the priestess almost never gave clear answers.

        Good morning, class! Last time we learned about some of the Roman gods and goddesses. Today, I'd like to tell you about a few more important gods and goddesses that the Romans worshipped.
Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. A blacksmith is someone who works with hot metal to make things. Vulcan would heat up iron and other metals until they were very hot. Then he would hammer and shape the metal to make swords, helmets, and shields for the other gods. Vulcan was also the god of fire and volcanoes. A volcano is a mountain that can shoot out hot melted rock and fire. The Romans believed that when a volcano erupted, it was because Vulcan was working hard in his workshop deep inside the earth.

Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and poetry. Both the Greeks and the Romans worshipped Apollo. He had a famous shrine at a place called Delphi in Greece. A shrine is a special holy place where people go to pray and worship their gods. When the Greeks and Romans needed advice about important decisions, they would send messengers to Apollo's shrine at Delphi. There, a priestess would speak for Apollo and give them answers. A priestess is a woman who serves a god or goddess in religious ceremonies. However, the priestess almost never gave clear answers.

        Good morning, class! Last time we learned about some of the Roman gods and goddesses. Today, I'd like to tell you about a few more important gods and goddesses that the Romans worshipped.
Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods. A blacksmith is someone who works with hot metal to make things. Vulcan would heat up iron and other metals until they were very hot. Then he would hammer and shape the metal to make swords, helmets, and shields for the other gods. Vulcan was also the god of fire and volcanoes. A volcano is a mountain that can shoot out hot melted rock and fire. The Romans believed that when a volcano erupted, it was because Vulcan was working hard in his workshop deep inside the earth.

Apollo was the god of the sun, music, and poetry. Both the Greeks and the Romans worshipped Apollo. He had a famous shrine at a place called Delphi in Greece. A shrine is a special holy place where people go to pray and worship their gods. When the Greeks and Romans needed advice about important decisions, they would send messengers to Apollo's shrine at Delphi. There, a priestess would speak for Apollo and give them answers. A priestess is a woman who serves a god or goddess in religious ceremonies. However, the priestess almost never gave clear answers. Instead, she would speak in riddles that people had to figure out for themselves.
Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, crafts, and weaving. According to Roman legend, Minerva was not born like other gods and goddesses. One day, Jupiter had a terrible headache. Suddenly, Minerva sprang out of his head, fully grown and ready for battle! Minerva's special animal was the owl, which Romans thought was very wise. Artists often painted pictures of Minerva with an owl sitting on her shoulder.

---

Diana was the goddess of the moon and hunting. In statues and paintings, artists showed Diana as a young woman carrying a bow and arrows for hunting. Sometimes they would also include her hunting dogs or a deer in the artwork.
Bacchus was the Roman god of grapes and wine. He was always followed by women and creatures called satyrs. A satyr was a magical creature that was half man and half goat. One famous story tells how pirates once tried to kidnap Bacchus. This was a terrible mistake! The angry god used his magic powers to turn himself into a fierce lion. He changed the pirates' boat into a beautiful garden full of plants. As punishment for trying to kidnap him, Bacchus turned all the pirates into dolphins and sent them splashing into the ocean forever.",,,,,Where in the passage would you look to find out which special animal was connected to wisdom?,MCQ,in the section about Apollo and his shrine at Delphi,in the section about Diana and her hunting activities,in the section about Minerva and her symbols in art,in the section about Bacchus and the magical satyrs,C,"Incorrect.

Bacchus was the Roman god of grapes and wine. He was always followed by women and creatures called satyrs. A satyr was a magical creature that was half man and half goat. One famous story tells how pirates once tried to kidnap Bacchus. This was a terrible mistake! The angry god used his magic powers to turn himself into a fierce lion. He changed the pirates' boat into a beautiful garden full of plants. As punishment for trying to kidnap him, Bacchus turned all the pirates into dolphins and sent them splashing into the ocean forever.",,,,,"Based on the passage, what happens as a direct result of Bacchus using his magic powers against the pirates?",MCQ,The satyrs and women stop following him through the forest.,The pirates learn to make grapes and wine like Bacchus.,The boat changes into a garden and the pirates become dolphins.,Vulcan creates special shields to protect Bacchus from pirates.,C,"Incorrect. The passage does not describe satyrs and women stopping their following of Bacchus. They are mentioned as his followers, but nothing suggests they leave him. Focus on what actually happens to the pirates and their boat.","Incorrect. The passage describes Bacchus punishing the pirates by transforming them, not teaching them his craft. The pirates become dolphins, which cannot make wine. Look for what the magic actually causes.",Correct! The passage states 'He changed the pirates' boat into a beautiful garden full of plants' and 'Bacchus turned all the pirates into dolphins and sent them splashing into the ocean forever.'

        Once there was a king who had three daughters. All three were pretty, but the youngest was named Psyche. She was so beautiful that no words could tell how lovely she was. People started to say she was more beautiful than Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.
Venus heard what people were saying about Psyche. She became very angry and jealous. How could people think a regular girl was prettier than a goddess? Venus decided this had to stop right away!
Venus went to find her son, Cupid. ""My son,"" she said, ""you must punish that girl! Take your bow and arrow and shoot her. Make her fall in love with the ugliest man on Earth."" Cupid always listened to his mother, so he agreed to do his mother's bidding.

---

Cupid took his bow and arrow and flew down to Earth. He found Psyche and took aim at her. But at the last second, his finger slipped on the arrow. Instead of shooting Psyche, he accidentally made the arrow prick his own finger. The magic arrow made Cupid fall in love with Psyche right away!
Now Cupid had a big problem. He loved Psyche, but he could not let his mother know. So he came up with a secret plan. He sent a message to Psyche's family. The message said that the gods had picked a husband for Psyche. She had to climb to the top of a mountain to meet him. The message also said her husband would be a terrible monster, not a man.
Psyche was scared, but she was also brave. She climbed up the mountain as the message told her to do. Halfway up the mountain, a warm wind lifted her up. Suddenly, she found herself in a magnificent palace with beautiful fountains and gardens everywhere.

---

At first, Psyche was all alone in the palace. When night came, she lay down on a soft bed. During the dark night, Cupid came to visit her. He told her he was the husband the gods had chosen for her. Cupid stayed with her all night and was very kind to her. But he always left before the sun came up.
Night after night, Cupid came to see Psyche. He only came when it was dark, and he always left before morning. Psyche only knew him in the darkness, but she accepted him as her husband. One night, Psyche became very curious. She asked her husband why he only came at night when she could not see him.
""Why do you want to see me?"" Cupid asked. ""What does it matter how I look? I love you and treat you well. All I ask is that you love me back.""

---

Psyche understood what her husband said. But she was still curious about what he looked like. Was he really a monster? She felt she had to find out the truth.
One night, Psyche waited until her husband fell asleep. Then she quietly got up and lit a small lamp. She carried the lamp over to the bed and held it up high. What she saw was not a monster at all! Instead, she saw the lovely face of Cupid himself. Her hand shook with surprise and joy. A drop of hot oil fell from the lamp onto Cupid's shoulder and woke him up.
Cupid looked up at Psyche with sad eyes. ""I only asked you to trust me,"" he said. ""But now I see that you do not trust me. When trust is gone, love must depart.""

Venus went to find her son, Cupid. ""My son,"" she said, ""you must punish that girl! Take your bow and arrow and shoot her. Make her fall in love with the ugliest man on Earth."" Cupid always listened to his mother, so he agreed to do his mother's bidding.

---

Cupid took his bow and arrow and flew down to Earth. He found Psyche and took aim at her. But at the last second, his finger slipped on the arrow. Instead of shooting Psyche, he accidentally made the arrow prick his own finger. The magic arrow made Cupid fall in love with Psyche right away!
Now Cupid had a big problem. He loved Psyche, but he could not let his mother know. So he came up with a secret plan. He sent a message to Psyche's family. The message said that the gods had picked a husband for Psyche. She had to climb to the top of a mountain to meet him. The message also said her husband would be a terrible monster, not a man.
Psyche was scared, but she was also brave. She climbed up the mountain as the message told her to do. Halfway up the mountain, a warm wind lifted her up. Suddenly, she found herself in a magnificent palace with beautiful fountains and gardens everywhere.

---

At first, Psyche was all alone in the palace. When night came, she lay down on a soft bed. During the dark night, Cupid came to visit her. He told her he was the husband the gods had chosen for her. Cupid stayed with her all night and was very kind to her. But he always left before the sun came up.
Night after night, Cupid came to see Psyche. He only came when it was dark, and he always left before morning. Psyche only knew him in the darkness, but she accepted him as her husband. One night, Psyche became very curious. She asked her husband why he only came at night when she could not see him.
""Why do you want to see me?"" Cupid asked. ""What does it matter how I look? I love you and treat you well. All I ask is that you love me back.""

Psyche understood what her husband said. But she was still curious about what he looked like. Was he really a monster? She felt she had to find out the truth.
One night, Psyche waited until her husband fell asleep. Then she quietly got up and lit a small lamp. She carried the lamp over to the bed and held it up high. What she saw was not a monster at all! Instead, she saw the lovely face of Cupid himself. Her hand shook with surprise and joy. A drop of hot oil fell from the lamp onto Cupid's shoulder and woke him up.
Cupid looked up at Psyche with sad eyes. ""I only asked you to trust me,"" he said. ""But now I see that you do not trust me. When trust is gone, love must depart.""

Psyche understood what her husband said. But she was still curious about what he looked like. Was he really a monster? She felt she had to find out the truth.
One night, Psyche waited until her husband fell asleep. Then she quietly got up and lit a small lamp. She carried the lamp over to the bed and held it up high. What she saw was not a monster at all! Instead, she saw the lovely face of Cupid himself. Her hand shook with surprise and joy. A drop of hot oil fell from the lamp onto Cupid's shoulder and woke him up.

Cupid does not say Psyche stopped loving him. His sad words focus on trust: 'I only asked you to trust me' and 'you do not trust me.' The issue is broken trust, not lack of love.

        Once there was a king who had three daughters. All three were pretty, but the youngest was named Psyche. She was so beautiful that no words could tell how lovely she was. People started to say she was more beautiful than Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.
Venus heard what people were saying about Psyche. She became very angry and jealous. How could people think a regular girl was prettier than a goddess? Venus decided this had to stop right away!
Venus went to find her son, Cupid. ""My son,"" she said, ""you must punish that girl! Take your bow and arrow and shoot her. Make her fall in love with the ugliest man on Earth."" Cupid always listened to his mother, so he agreed to do his mother's bidding.

---

Cupid took his bow and arrow and flew down to Earth. He found Psyche and took aim at her. But at the last second, his finger slipped on the arrow. Instead of shooting Psyche, he accidentally made the arrow prick his own finger. The magic arrow made Cupid fall in love with Psyche right away!
Now Cupid had a big problem. He loved Psyche, but he could not let his mother know. So he came up with a secret plan. He sent a message to Psyche's family. The message said that the gods had picked a husband for Psyche. She had to climb to the top of a mountain to meet him. The message also said her husband would be a terrible monster, not a man.
Psyche was scared, but she was also brave. She climbed up the mountain as the message told her to do. Halfway up the mountain, a warm wind lifted her up. Suddenly, she found herself in a magnificent palace with beautiful fountains and gardens everywhere.

---

At first, Psyche was all alone in the palace. When night came, she lay down on a soft bed. During the dark night, Cupid came to visit her. He told her he was the husband the gods had chosen for her. Cupid stayed with her all night and was very kind to her. But he always left before the sun came up.
Night after night, Cupid came to see Psyche. He only came when it was dark, and he always left before morning. Psyche only knew him in the darkness, but she accepted him as her husband. One night, Psyche became very curious. She asked her husband why he only came at night when she could not see him.

        When Cupid left Psyche, she felt very sad. She looked for Cupid everywhere. She walked during the day and night. But she could not find her lost love anywhere. Finally, Psyche went to Venus's temple. She asked the goddess to help her find Cupid. Venus did not want to help. She was still jealous of Psyche's beauty. Venus was confident that she could give Psyche a task that was too hard to finish.
Venus led Psyche to a huge pile of grain. The pile had wheat, millet, barley, and lentils all mixed together. ""Sort all the grains into separate stacks by morning,"" Venus ordered. Then she gave a mean laugh and disappeared. Psyche saw millions of seeds in the pile. She knew she could never finish this job. She sat down and began to cry.

Then something amazing happened. Through her tears, Psyche saw one seed moving, then another, and then many more. An army of ants had come to aid her! Each ant carried a seed. Working together, they sorted all the seeds into separate piles. In the morning, Venus was shocked to find the work was done.
""Your next task will be much harder!"" Venus said. ""Take this box to the underworld and ask Queen Proserpina to send me some of her beauty."" Psyche's heart sank. No human had ever gone to the underworld and come back alive. Just then, a mysterious voice spoke to her.

""Take a coin for the boatman,"" the voice said. ""If you pay him, he will carry you across the river to the underworld. Take a cake too.

        When Cupid left Psyche, she felt very sad. She looked for Cupid everywhere. She walked during the day and night. But she could not find her lost love anywhere. Finally, Psyche went to Venus's temple. She asked the goddess to help her find Cupid. Venus did not want to help. She was still jealous of Psyche's beauty. Venus was confident that she could give Psyche a task that was too hard to finish.
Venus led Psyche to a huge pile of grain. The pile had wheat, millet, barley, and lentils all mixed together. ""Sort all the grains into separate stacks by morning,"" Venus ordered.

        When Cupid left Psyche, she felt very sad. She looked for Cupid everywhere. She walked during the day and night. But she could not find her lost love anywhere. Finally, Psyche went to Venus's temple. She asked the goddess to help her find Cupid. Venus did not want to help. She was still jealous of Psyche's beauty. Venus was confident that she could give Psyche a task that was too hard to finish.
Venus led Psyche to a huge pile of grain. The pile had wheat, millet, barley, and lentils all mixed together. ""Sort all the grains into separate stacks by morning,"" Venus ordered. Then she gave a mean laugh and disappeared. Psyche saw millions of seeds in the pile. She knew she could never finish this job. She sat down and began to cry.

---

Then something amazing happened. Through her tears, Psyche saw one seed moving, then another, and then many more. An army of ants had come to aid her! Each ant carried a seed. Working together, they sorted all the seeds into separate piles. In the morning, Venus was shocked to find the work was done.
""Your next task will be much harder!"" Venus said. ""Take this box to the underworld and ask Queen Proserpina to send me some of her beauty."" Psyche's heart sank. No human had ever gone to the underworld and come back alive. Just then, a mysterious voice spoke to her.

---

""Take a coin for the boatman,"" the voice said. ""If you pay him, he will carry you across the river to the underworld. Take a cake too. Give the cake to the three-headed dog who guards the entrance, and he will let you pass. Most important of all, once Proserpina puts beauty in the box, do not open it!""
Psyche followed the voice's advice. She traveled safely to the underworld. Queen Proserpina gave her the box of beauty for Venus. But Psyche wondered what was inside the box. She lifted the lid and looked inside. A deep sleep came over her right away. She fell to the ground.

---

Luckily, Cupid was watching over her. Even though he was upset with Psyche, he still loved her very much. When he saw her lying on the ground, he felt pity for her. He lifted the sleeping spell and Psyche woke up. ""See what happens when you are too curious?"" Cupid said with a smile. Psyche smiled back at him.
Psyche brought the box to Venus. Then Cupid went to Jupiter and asked to marry Psyche with the king of the gods' blessing. Jupiter agreed. He let Psyche drink ambrosia, the special drink of the gods.

        Have you ever wished you could be a king? Does that seem like the best job in the world? Well, before you decide, listen to this old story. A Roman writer named Cicero told this story more than two thousand years ago.
Damocles was a friend of Dionysius, who was the king of Syracuse. This was a big city in southern Italy. Damocles looked at his friend's life and felt jealous. He would envy the king because he thought the king had everything good in life. The king had lots of money, a big palace, and all the power he wanted. What could be better than that?

""You think I'm lucky?"" Dionysius said to his friend one day. ""If you really think so, let's switch places. You can sit on my throne. Try being king for just one day. Then tell me if you still think I'm the lucky one.""
Damocles said yes right away. He was very excited to live like a king, even if it was just for one day. He thought it would be the best day of his life.

---

When the special day came, Damocles told servants to bring him the finest clothes. He ordered them to make a great banquet with lots of delicious food. He wanted expensive wine and beautiful music too. He sat back in the king's chair, sure that he was the happiest person in the whole world.
Then he looked up at the ceiling. He gasped in fear! Above his head was a sharp sword. It was hanging from the ceiling, held up by just one thin piece of horse hair. The sword would dangle right over his head. Damocles could not speak. He could not eat any of the good food. He could not enjoy the music. He was too scared to even move.

""What is wrong, my friend?"" asked Dionysius.
""How can I conduct my life with that sword hanging above me?"" Damocles asked. ""It might fall at any time!""
""How indeed?"" answered Dionysius. ""Now you know what it feels like to be king. That sword hangs over my head every minute of every day. There is always a chance the thin hair will break.

Damocles was a friend of Dionysius, who was the king of Syracuse. This was a big city in southern Italy. Damocles looked at his friend's life and felt jealous. He would envy the king because he thought the king had everything good in life. The king had lots of money, a big palace, and all the power he wanted. What could be better than that?

---

""You think I'm lucky?"" Dionysius said to his friend one day. ""If you really think so, let's switch places. You can sit on my throne. Try being king for just one day. Then tell me if you still think I'm the lucky one.""
Damocles said yes right away. He was very excited to live like a king, even if it was just for one day. He thought it would be the best day of his life.

---

When the special day came, Damocles told servants to bring him the finest clothes. He ordered them to make a great banquet with lots of delicious food. He wanted expensive wine and beautiful music too. He sat back in the king's chair, sure that he was the happiest person in the whole world.
Then he looked up at the ceiling. He gasped in fear! Above his head was a sharp sword. It was hanging from the ceiling, held up by just one thin piece of horse hair. The sword would dangle right over his head. Damocles could not speak. He could not eat any of the good food. He could not enjoy the music. He was too scared to even move.

---

""What is wrong, my friend?"" asked Dionysius.
""How can I conduct my life with that sword hanging above me?"" Damocles asked. ""It might fall at any time!""
""How indeed?"" answered Dionysius. ""Now you know what it feels like to be king. That sword hangs over my head every minute of every day. There is always a chance the thin hair will break. An advisor who helps me might turn against me. An enemy might try to hurt me. I might make a bad choice that causes my downfall. You see, my friend, when you have power, danger comes with it.""",,,,,Why does Damocles's experience with the banquet illustrate his character change?,MCQ,It shows he learns to appreciate simple things instead of luxury.,It demonstrates how anticipation of pleasure turns into complete inability to enjoy it.,It reveals he becomes more interested in safety than in entertainment.,It proves he realizes friendship matters more than material possessions.,B,"Incorrect. The story doesn't show Damocles learning to appreciate simple things. He wanted luxury and couldn't enjoy it because of fear, but the text doesn't indicate he now prefers simplicity. Review paragraph 3 to see what actually prevents his enjoyment.","Correct! This captures the irony of his transformation. Paragraph 3 shows he eagerly arranged 'a great banquet with lots of delicious food...expensive wine and beautiful music,' anticipating pleasure. But after seeing the sword, 'He could not eat any of the good food. He could not enjoy the music.' His eager anticipation completely transforms into inability to enjoy anything.","Incorrect. While fear of the sword does make him focus on safety, this doesn't fully capture his character change. The key transformation is from excited anticipation to paralyzed fear that prevents enjoyment, not just a shift in priorities. Reread paragraph 3 for the complete picture.","Incorrect.

""You think I'm lucky?"" Dionysius said to his friend one day. ""If you really think so, let's switch places. You can sit on my throne. Try being king for just one day. Then tell me if you still think I'm the lucky one.""
Damocles said yes right away. He was very excited to live like a king, even if it was just for one day. He thought it would be the best day of his life.

When the special day came, Damocles told servants to bring him the finest clothes. He ordered them to make a great banquet with lots of delicious food. He wanted expensive wine and beautiful music too. He sat back in the king's chair, sure that he was the happiest person in the whole world.
Then he looked up at the ceiling. He gasped in fear! Above his head was a sharp sword. It was hanging from the ceiling, held up by just one thin piece of horse hair. The sword would dangle right over his head. Damocles could not speak. He could not eat any of the good food. He could not enjoy the music. He was too scared to even move.

        Have you ever wished you could be a king? Does that seem like the best job in the world? Well, before you decide, listen to this old story. A Roman writer named Cicero told this story more than two thousand years ago.
Damocles was a friend of Dionysius, who was the king of Syracuse. This was a big city in southern Italy. Damocles looked at his friend's life and felt jealous. He would envy the king because he thought the king had everything good in life. The king had lots of money, a big palace, and all the power he wanted. What could be better than that?

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well. Some were bad men who treated the Romans poorly. One king was so terrible that he made the Romans decide they should get rid of kings forever. His name was Tarquin. The Romans called him Tarquin the Proud.
Tarquin was a tyrant. He was a cruel ruler who treated the people badly. He made unfair laws and hurt anyone who spoke against him. In the end, the people got so angry at Tarquin that they joined together and drove him out of Rome. Once King Tarquin had been kicked out, the Romans set up a completely different kind of government. They created a republic—a type of government with no kings at all.

---

One of the most important parts of the Roman republic was the Senate. The Senate was a group of older men who met together to make decisions and pass laws for Rome. Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

---

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.
The patricians came from wealthy, old families that had lived in Rome for many years. All of the men in the Senate were patricians. In the early days of the republic, the men chosen to be consuls were also patricians. The rest of the people—the ones who were not patricians—were called plebeians. The plebeians were the poorer people who had very little power in the government.

---

The Roman republic lasted for more than five hundred years. Many Romans loved their republic and thought it was the best kind of government a country could have. However, they were not the only ones who felt this way about republics.
The Founding Fathers of the United States also believed a republic was the best form of government. When the American colonies broke away from Great Britain in 1776, they left behind a king and set up their own republic. They created a Senate that was based on the Roman Senate.

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well. Some were bad men who treated the Romans poorly. One king was so terrible that he made the Romans decide they should get rid of kings forever. His name was Tarquin. The Romans called him Tarquin the Proud.
Tarquin was a tyrant. He was a cruel ruler who treated the people badly. He made unfair laws and hurt anyone who spoke against him. In the end, the people got so angry at Tarquin that they joined together and drove him out of Rome. Once King Tarquin had been kicked out, the Romans set up a completely different kind of government. They created a republic—a type of government with no kings at all.

One of the most important parts of the Roman republic was the Senate. The Senate was a group of older men who met together to make decisions and pass laws for Rome. Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.
The patricians came from wealthy, old families that had lived in Rome for many years. All of the men in the Senate were patricians. In the early days of the republic, the men chosen to be consuls were also patricians. The rest of the people—the ones who were not patricians—were called plebeians. The plebeians were the poorer people who had very little power in the government.

The Roman republic lasted for more than five hundred years. Many Romans loved their republic and thought it was the best kind of government a country could have. However, they were not the only ones who felt this way about republics.
The Founding Fathers of the United States also believed a republic was the best form of government. When the American colonies broke away from Great Britain in 1776, they left behind a king and set up their own republic. They created a Senate that was based on the Roman Senate.

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well. Some were bad men who treated the Romans poorly. One king was so terrible that he made the Romans decide they should get rid of kings forever. His name was Tarquin. The Romans called him Tarquin the Proud.
Tarquin was a tyrant. He was a cruel ruler who treated the people badly. He made unfair laws and hurt anyone who spoke against him. In the end, the people got so angry at Tarquin that they joined together and drove him out of Rome. Once King Tarquin had been kicked out, the Romans set up a completely different kind of government. They created a republic—a type of government with no kings at all.

One of the most important parts of the Roman republic was the Senate. The Senate was a group of older men who met together to make decisions and pass laws for Rome. Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.

        For many years, Rome was ruled by kings. This type of government with a king is called a monarchy. Some of these kings were good men who ruled well. Some were bad men who treated the Romans poorly. One king was so terrible that he made the Romans decide they should get rid of kings forever. His name was Tarquin. The Romans called him Tarquin the Proud.
Tarquin was a tyrant. He was a cruel ruler who treated the people badly. He made unfair laws and hurt anyone who spoke against him. In the end, the people got so angry at Tarquin that they joined together and drove him out of Rome. Once King Tarquin had been kicked out, the Romans set up a completely different kind of government. They created a republic—a type of government with no kings at all.

---

One of the most important parts of the Roman republic was the Senate. The Senate was a group of older men who met together to make decisions and pass laws for Rome. Many of the senators came from old, wealthy families. Almost all of them had fought bravely in the army and earned the trust of their fellow Romans through their service.
Each year, the Roman people would elect two men to serve as leaders called consuls. To be chosen as a consul was a great honor. It was the most powerful job an official could have in the Roman republic. The two consuls worked together to run the government and lead the army when Rome went to war.

---

Rome was a republic, but it was not a democracy. In a democracy, all people have equal power in government. But in Rome, some people had lots of power while many others had none at all. In the early years of the Roman republic, one group held most of the control. These people were called patricians. The word patrician comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. The patricians thought of themselves as the fathers of all the people. They believed it was their job to take care of everyone else, just like parents take care of their children.
The patricians came from wealthy, old families that had lived in Rome for many years. All of the men in the Senate were patricians. In the early days of the republic, the men chosen to be consuls were also patricians. The rest of the people—the ones who were not patricians—were called plebeians. The plebeians were the poorer people who had very little power in the government.

---

The Roman republic lasted for more than five hundred years. Many Romans loved their republic and thought it was the best kind of government a country could have. However, they were not the only ones who felt this way about republics.
The Founding Fathers of the United States also believed a republic was the best form of government. When the American colonies broke away from Great Britain in 1776, they left behind a king and set up their own republic. They created a Senate that was based on the Roman Senate. They created a president who had powers similar to the Roman consuls. They even built government buildings that looked like ancient Roman structures.

        The Romans fought many enemies, but their strongest enemy was an African general named Hannibal. Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast of Africa. Carthage was home to many merchants and traders. The people of Carthage also had a strong army and navy. They took over much of North Africa and Spain. They even took over islands near Italy. The Romans saw Carthage as a rival. A rival is someone who competes against you. The Romans fought three wars against Carthage. These wars are called the Punic Wars. They were fought from 264 to 146 BC.
Hannibal's father fought against Rome in the First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC. He made his son promise to keep fighting Rome. Hannibal promised he would and kept his word. Hannibal led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

---

Hannibal gathered a huge army in Spain. He had tens of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special forces: a group of elephants. Hannibal knew that few men were brave enough to fight when they saw a thundering group of elephants coming their way.
Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. But to get to Italy, he had to march his army over tall mountains called the Alps. The Alps were very high. The mountain tops were covered with snow and ice. There were no big roads across them. There were only a few slippery paths.
Most men would not have tried to cross the mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered terribly. Some died from rockslides or from an avalanche. An avalanche is when snow and ice come crashing down a mountain. Others froze to death. Many of the elephants did not make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army across the mountains and into Italy.

---

In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack. He beat the Romans at Trebbia in 218 BC. Then he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of Trasimene in 217 BC. The Romans lost 15,000 men. The Battle of Cannae was even worse. The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including 80 of their 300 senators.
People thought this might be the end for Rome. They did not see how the Romans could keep going. But the Romans did keep going. They raised another army to stop Hannibal. This time, the Romans avoided big battles. Instead, they fought many small battles. They attacked Hannibal's army here and there. They blocked his troops and slowed down his marches. They also launched a counter-attack. A counter-attack is when you fight back against your enemy. A Roman general named Scipio took Roman troops to Africa. The leaders of Carthage wrote to Hannibal. They told him to come home and protect Carthage.

---

Hannibal did as he was told. He left Italy and returned to Carthage. At the Battle of Zama, he had to confront Scipio. To confront means to face someone in battle. This time, the Romans were victorious. Being victorious means winning the battle. Hannibal won most of the battles in the Second Punic War, but he lost the war.

        The Romans fought many enemies, but their strongest enemy was an African general named Hannibal. Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast of Africa. Carthage was home to many merchants and traders. The people of Carthage also had a strong army and navy. They took over much of North Africa and Spain. They even took over islands near Italy. The Romans saw Carthage as a rival. A rival is someone who competes against you. The Romans fought three wars against Carthage. These wars are called the Punic Wars. They were fought from 264 to 146 BC.
Hannibal's father fought against Rome in the First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC. He made his son promise to keep fighting Rome. Hannibal promised he would and kept his word. Hannibal led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

---

Hannibal gathered a huge army in Spain. He had tens of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special forces: a group of elephants. Hannibal knew that few men were brave enough to fight when they saw a thundering group of elephants coming their way.
Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. But to get to Italy, he had to march his army over tall mountains called the Alps. The Alps were very high. The mountain tops were covered with snow and ice. There were no big roads across them. There were only a few slippery paths.
Most men would not have tried to cross the mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered terribly. Some died from rockslides or from an avalanche. An avalanche is when snow and ice come crashing down a mountain. Others froze to death. Many of the elephants did not make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army across the mountains and into Italy.

---

In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack. He beat the Romans at Trebbia in 218 BC. Then he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of Trasimene in 217 BC. The Romans lost 15,000 men. The Battle of Cannae was even worse. The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including 80 of their 300 senators.
People thought this might be the end for Rome. They did not see how the Romans could keep going. But the Romans did keep going. They raised another army to stop Hannibal. This time, the Romans avoided big battles. Instead, they fought many small battles. They attacked Hannibal's army here and there. They blocked his troops and slowed down his marches. They also launched a counter-attack. A counter-attack is when you fight back against your enemy. A Roman general named Scipio took Roman troops to Africa. The leaders of Carthage wrote to Hannibal. They told him to come home and protect Carthage.

---

Hannibal did as he was told. He left Italy and returned to Carthage. At the Battle of Zama, he had to confront Scipio. To confront means to face someone in battle. This time, the Romans were victorious. Being victorious means winning the battle. Hannibal won most of the battles in the Second Punic War, but he lost the war.

        The Romans fought many enemies, but their strongest enemy was an African general named Hannibal. Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast of Africa. Carthage was home to many merchants and traders. The people of Carthage also had a strong army and navy. They took over much of North Africa and Spain. They even took over islands near Italy. The Romans saw Carthage as a rival. A rival is someone who competes against you. The Romans fought three wars against Carthage. These wars are called the Punic Wars. They were fought from 264 to 146 BC.
Hannibal's father fought against Rome in the First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC. He made his son promise to keep fighting Rome. Hannibal promised he would and kept his word. Hannibal led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

---

Hannibal gathered a huge army in Spain. He had tens of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special forces: a group of elephants. Hannibal knew that few men were brave enough to fight when they saw a thundering group of elephants coming their way.
Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. But to get to Italy, he had to march his army over tall mountains called the Alps. The Alps were very high. The mountain tops were covered with snow and ice. There were no big roads across them. There were only a few slippery paths.
Most men would not have tried to cross the mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered terribly. Some died from rockslides or from an avalanche. An avalanche is when snow and ice come crashing down a mountain. Others froze to death. Many of the elephants did not make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army across the mountains and into Italy.

In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack. He beat the Romans at Trebbia in 218 BC. Then he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of Trasimene in 217 BC. The Romans lost 15,000 men. The Battle of Cannae was even worse. The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including 80 of their 300 senators.

Hannibal's father fought against Rome in the First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC. He made his son promise to keep fighting Rome. Hannibal promised he would and kept his word. Hannibal led the fight against Rome in the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

---

Hannibal gathered a huge army in Spain. He had tens of thousands of foot soldiers. He had thousands more who fought on horseback. Best of all, he had his special forces: a group of elephants. Hannibal knew that few men were brave enough to fight when they saw a thundering group of elephants coming their way.
Hannibal wanted to attack Rome. But to get to Italy, he had to march his army over tall mountains called the Alps. The Alps were very high. The mountain tops were covered with snow and ice. There were no big roads across them. There were only a few slippery paths.
Most men would not have tried to cross the mountains, but Hannibal was not like most men. He marched his army over the mountains. His men suffered terribly. Some died from rockslides or from an avalanche. An avalanche is when snow and ice come crashing down a mountain. Others froze to death. Many of the elephants did not make it across. In the end, though, Hannibal got his army across the mountains and into Italy.

---

In Italy, Hannibal went on the attack. He beat the Romans at Trebbia in 218 BC. Then he wiped out an entire Roman army at the Battle of Trasimene in 217 BC. The Romans lost 15,000 men. The Battle of Cannae was even worse. The Romans lost at least 50,000 men, including 80 of their 300 senators.
People thought this might be the end for Rome. They did not see how the Romans could keep going. But the Romans did keep going. They raised another army to stop Hannibal. This time, the Romans avoided big battles. Instead, they fought many small battles. They attacked Hannibal's army here and there. They blocked his troops and slowed down his marches. They also launched a counter-attack. A counter-attack is when you fight back against your enemy. A Roman general named Scipio took Roman troops to Africa. The leaders of Carthage wrote to Hannibal. They told him to come home and protect Carthage.

---

Hannibal did as he was told. He left Italy and returned to Carthage. At the Battle of Zama, he had to confront Scipio. To confront means to face someone in battle. This time, the Romans were victorious. Being victorious means winning the battle. Hannibal won most of the battles in the Second Punic War, but he lost the war.
After the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, Carthage was never the same. They fought one more war against Rome. This was the Third Punic War from 149 to 146 BC. But it was clear that Carthage was getting weaker and Rome was getting stronger.",,,,,Why did the leaders of Carthage write to Hannibal telling him to return home?,MCQ,They wanted him to attack the Alps again with more elephants,Rome had sent troops to Africa threatening Carthage itself,He had already defeated all the Roman armies in Italy,The First Punic War was starting and they needed him,B,"Incorrect. The passage describes Hannibal crossing the Alps once to get to Italy, but there is no mention of Carthage wanting him to attack the Alps again or to get more elephants. The leaders called him home to defend Carthage, not to launch another Alps crossing. Reread paragraph 4 carefully to find the real reason they recalled him.","Correct! The passage provides explicit text evidence: 'A Roman general named Scipio took Roman troops to Africa. The leaders of Carthage wrote to Hannibal. They told him to come home and protect Carthage.' The cause-effect relationship is clear - because Rome attacked Africa (where Carthage was located), threatening their home city, the leaders needed Hannibal to return to defend it. This shows strategic reasoning based on multiple pieces of evidence.","Incorrect. While Hannibal had won major battles at Trebbia, Trasimene, and Cannae, the passage does not say he had defeated all Roman armies. In fact, the text explains that 'the Romans did keep going. They raised another army to stop Hannibal.' Rome was still fighting. The recall happened because of a threat to Carthage, not because Hannibal had finished in Italy.",Incorrect. The First Punic War occurred from 264 to 241 BC and was already over long before the events described. Hannibal's father fought in that war. Hannibal was leading the Second Punic War (218-201 BC) when he was called home. The timeline is wrong here.

        The Romans fought many enemies, but their strongest enemy was an African general named Hannibal. Hannibal came from Carthage, a city on the coast of Africa. Carthage was home to many merchants and traders. The people of Carthage also had a strong army and navy. They took over much of North Africa and Spain. They even took over islands near Italy. The Romans saw Carthage as a rival. A rival is someone who competes against you. The Romans fought three wars against Carthage. These wars are called the Punic Wars.

The text explains Rome changed tactics: 'they avoided big battles' and 'fought many small battles.' Paragraph 5 shows Rome's counter-attack forced Hannibal home where 'the Romans were victorious' at Zama.

        After the Punic Wars, Roman generals became very important people. These generals traveled all around the Mediterranean Sea. They fought battles and took over new lands for Rome. Some generals became famous heroes. They were so popular that people worried they might try to take control of the whole republic. This is exactly what happened with a man named Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family that had been important for many years. He was very proud and wanted to become powerful. Caesar had a very high opinion of himself. When Caesar was still a young man, something exciting happened to him. Pirates captured him while he was traveling by ship!

---

The pirates told Caesar they would kill him unless someone paid them money. This payment to free a prisoner is called a ransom. They wanted twenty talents of gold. A talent was a lot of money in those days. But Caesar just laughed at the pirates! He told them they clearly did not know what kind of important man they had captured. Caesar said he would not allow himself to be ransomed for such a small amount. He demanded they ask for fifty talents instead!
Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

---

The pirates thought Caesar was just joking or maybe even crazy. As soon as they got their ransom money, they let him go and forgot all about him. But Caesar never forgot about them. He went back to Rome and got some ships. He hired good fighters and tracked down those pirates. Then he killed them, just like he had promised!
Caesar quickly learned to establish himself as a great leader. To establish means to set up or create something strong. He was good with both his sword for fighting and his pen for writing. Once, Caesar was sent to Asia because the people there were in revolt. A revolt is when people fight against their rulers. Caesar led a Roman army and stopped the revolt. Then he wrote his report to Rome.

---

Most generals wrote long reports that filled many pages. But that was not Caesar's style. His whole report was just three Latin words: ""Veni, vidi, vici."" In English, this means ""I came, I saw, I conquered."" What else needed to be said? Mission accomplished!
Later, Caesar led an army into a land called Gaul. Today we call this place France. When Caesar marched in, Gaul was not part of Roman civilization. But when he marched out years later, it belonged to Rome. Caesar had conquered the whole land. Then he wrote a famous book about how he did it.

Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

The pirates thought Caesar was just joking or maybe even crazy. As soon as they got their ransom money, they let him go and forgot all about him. But Caesar never forgot about them. He went back to Rome and got some ships. He hired good fighters and tracked down those pirates. Then he killed them, just like he had promised!
Caesar quickly learned to establish himself as a great leader. To establish means to set up or create something strong. He was good with both his sword for fighting and his pen for writing. Once, Caesar was sent to Asia because the people there were in revolt. A revolt is when people fight against their rulers. Caesar led a Roman army and stopped the revolt.

        After the Punic Wars, Roman generals became very important people. These generals traveled all around the Mediterranean Sea. They fought battles and took over new lands for Rome. Some generals became famous heroes. They were so popular that people worried they might try to take control of the whole republic. This is exactly what happened with a man named Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family that had been important for many years. He was very proud and wanted to become powerful. Caesar had a very high opinion of himself. When Caesar was still a young man, something exciting happened to him. Pirates captured him while he was traveling by ship!

---

The pirates told Caesar they would kill him unless someone paid them money. This payment to free a prisoner is called a ransom. They wanted twenty talents of gold. A talent was a lot of money in those days. But Caesar just laughed at the pirates! He told them they clearly did not know what kind of important man they had captured. Caesar said he would not allow himself to be ransomed for such a small amount. He demanded they ask for fifty talents instead!
Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

---

The pirates thought Caesar was just joking or maybe even crazy. As soon as they got their ransom money, they let him go and forgot all about him. But Caesar never forgot about them. He went back to Rome and got some ships. He hired good fighters and tracked down those pirates. Then he killed them, just like he had promised!
Caesar quickly learned to establish himself as a great leader. To establish means to set up or create something strong. He was good with both his sword for fighting and his pen for writing. Once, Caesar was sent to Asia because the people there were in revolt. A revolt is when people fight against their rulers. Caesar led a Roman army and stopped the revolt. Then he wrote his report to Rome.

        After the Punic Wars, Roman generals became very important people. These generals traveled all around the Mediterranean Sea. They fought battles and took over new lands for Rome. Some generals became famous heroes. They were so popular that people worried they might try to take control of the whole republic. This is exactly what happened with a man named Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar came from an old Roman family that had been important for many years. He was very proud and wanted to become powerful. Caesar had a very high opinion of himself. When Caesar was still a young man, something exciting happened to him. Pirates captured him while he was traveling by ship!

---

The pirates told Caesar they would kill him unless someone paid them money. This payment to free a prisoner is called a ransom. They wanted twenty talents of gold. A talent was a lot of money in those days. But Caesar just laughed at the pirates! He told them they clearly did not know what kind of important man they had captured. Caesar said he would not allow himself to be ransomed for such a small amount. He demanded they ask for fifty talents instead!
Caesar sent word to his friends to raise the money. While he waited with the pirates, he wrote poems and read them out loud. The pirates did not like his poetry at all. They just shrugged their shoulders. They were pirates, not poets! They only cared about getting their ransom money. This made Caesar very angry. He scolded the pirates for not liking his poems. He called them barbarians because they had no taste for good writing. A barbarian is someone who is not civilized. Caesar promised he would come back someday to punish them.

---

The pirates thought Caesar was just joking or maybe even crazy. As soon as they got their ransom money, they let him go and forgot all about him. But Caesar never forgot about them. He went back to Rome and got some ships. He hired good fighters and tracked down those pirates. Then he killed them, just like he had promised!
Caesar quickly learned to establish himself as a great leader. To establish means to set up or create something strong. He was good with both his sword for fighting and his pen for writing. Once, Caesar was sent to Asia because the people there were in revolt. A revolt is when people fight against their rulers. Caesar led a Roman army and stopped the revolt. Then he wrote his report to Rome.

---

Most generals wrote long reports that filled many pages. But that was not Caesar's style. His whole report was just three Latin words: ""Veni, vidi, vici."" In English, this means ""I came, I saw, I conquered."" What else needed to be said? Mission accomplished!
Later, Caesar led an army into a land called Gaul. Today we call this place France. When Caesar marched in, Gaul was not part of Roman civilization. But when he marched out years later, it belonged to Rome. Caesar had conquered the whole land. Then he wrote a famous book about how he did it.

        After Caesar won his battles in Gaul, he started marching back to Rome. The Roman senators were very worried about Caesar. They thought he might march into Rome and take over their government. The senators sent Caesar a message. They told him to stop and send his soldiers home. They ordered him not to cross the Rubicon River. If he crossed it, they said he would not be treated as a hero. Instead, he would be treated as a traitor and an enemy of Rome.
In the year 49 BC, Caesar made his choice. He crossed the Rubicon River with his army. He said in Latin, ""The die is cast."" That was his way of saying he knew he was taking a big risk. Crossing the Rubicon meant there was no turning back. He had to fight or lose everything.

---

Caesar's actions started a civil war. A civil war is when people from the same country fight against each other. Caesar was the leader on one side. Pompey, another famous Roman general, was the leader on the other side. Caesar defeated Pompey in battle. Then he chased Pompey all the way to Egypt, where Pompey was killed.
When Caesar got to Egypt, he found that this country was also having a civil war. The princess Cleopatra was trying to take power away from her brother. Caesar decided to help Cleopatra. With his support, she became the Queen of Egypt. Caesar and Cleopatra became close friends and worked together to rule Egypt.

---

Caesar had big plans for Rome. He didn't think Rome was being run the right way. He wanted to change many things. He made the Senate pass new laws. He replaced the old calendar with the one we still use today. Did you know that the month of July is named for Julius Caesar?
Caesar wanted to do more, but he felt he needed more power. He got himself appointed dictator. At first, he was appointed dictator for only one year. That was not so unusual. The Romans had chosen dictators before during times of trouble. But a dictator was only supposed to rule for a short time. That was not what Caesar had in mind. He had himself appointed dictator for ten years. That upset many people. Later, Caesar had himself appointed dictator for life. That was really too much for some Romans.

For hundreds of years, Rome had been a republic where people had a say in government. Now Caesar was setting himself up as a dictator forever. Maybe he even wanted to be a king. That was very upsetting to many Romans. They had gotten rid of kings hundreds of years earlier.
A group of Romans decided that Caesar was dangerous to their republic. They made a plan to kill him. These men were called conspirators. A conspirator is someone who makes secret plans with others. The conspirators stabbed Caesar to death in the Senate building. Some of the men who killed Caesar were people he thought were his friends.

Caesar's actions started a civil war. A civil war is when people from the same country fight against each other. Caesar was the leader on one side. Pompey, another famous Roman general, was the leader on the other side. Caesar defeated Pompey in battle. Then he chased Pompey all the way to Egypt, where Pompey was killed.
When Caesar got to Egypt, he found that this country was also having a civil war. The princess Cleopatra was trying to take power away from her brother. Caesar decided to help Cleopatra. With his support, she became the Queen of Egypt. Caesar and Cleopatra became close friends and worked together to rule Egypt.

Caesar had big plans for Rome. He didn't think Rome was being run the right way. He wanted to change many things. He made the Senate pass new laws. He replaced the old calendar with the one we still use today. Did you know that the month of July is named for Julius Caesar?
Caesar wanted to do more, but he felt he needed more power. He got himself appointed dictator. At first, he was appointed dictator for only one year. That was not so unusual. The Romans had chosen dictators before during times of trouble. But a dictator was only supposed to rule for a short time. That was not what Caesar had in mind. He had himself appointed dictator for ten years. That upset many people. Later, Caesar had himself appointed dictator for life. That was really too much for some Romans.

        After Caesar won his battles in Gaul, he started marching back to Rome. The Roman senators were very worried about Caesar. They thought he might march into Rome and take over their government. The senators sent Caesar a message. They told him to stop and send his soldiers home. They ordered him not to cross the Rubicon River. If he crossed it, they said he would not be treated as a hero. Instead, he would be treated as a traitor and an enemy of Rome.
In the year 49 BC, Caesar made his choice. He crossed the Rubicon River with his army. He said in Latin, ""The die is cast."" That was his way of saying he knew he was taking a big risk. Crossing the Rubicon meant there was no turning back. He had to fight or lose everything.

Caesar's actions started a civil war. A civil war is when people from the same country fight against each other. Caesar was the leader on one side. Pompey, another famous Roman general, was the leader on the other side. Caesar defeated Pompey in battle. Then he chased Pompey all the way to Egypt, where Pompey was killed.
When Caesar got to Egypt, he found that this country was also having a civil war. The princess Cleopatra was trying to take power away from her brother. Caesar decided to help Cleopatra. With his support, she became the Queen of Egypt. Caesar and Cleopatra became close friends and worked together to rule Egypt.

Caesar had big plans for Rome. He didn't think Rome was being run the right way. He wanted to change many things. He made the Senate pass new laws. He replaced the old calendar with the one we still use today. Did you know that the month of July is named for Julius Caesar?
Caesar wanted to do more, but he felt he needed more power. He got himself appointed dictator. At first, he was appointed dictator for only one year. That was not so unusual. The Romans had chosen dictators before during times of trouble. But a dictator was only supposed to rule for a short time. That was not what Caesar had in mind. He had himself appointed dictator for ten years. That upset many people. Later, Caesar had himself appointed dictator for life. That was really too much for some Romans.

For hundreds of years, Rome had been a republic where people had a say in government. Now Caesar was setting himself up as a dictator forever. Maybe he even wanted to be a king. That was very upsetting to many Romans. They had gotten rid of kings hundreds of years earlier.
A group of Romans decided that Caesar was dangerous to their republic. They made a plan to kill him. These men were called conspirators. A conspirator is someone who makes secret plans with others. The conspirators stabbed Caesar to death in the Senate building. Some of the men who killed Caesar were people he thought were his friends.

article_101049,After Caesar: Augustus and the Roman Empire,test_quiz,5,quiz_302395_sibling_1,quiz,,"After Caesar: Augustus and the Roman Empire
    
    
        The men who killed Julius Caesar wanted to save the republic. But they did not succeed. After Caesar died, another civil war started. The man who won the war was called Augustus Caesar, or just Augustus.
Augustus was Caesar's adopted son. He agreed with Caesar that Rome needed to change. But Augustus was very smart. He knew that Romans loved their history and old ways. They would be angry if he changed everything at once. So Augustus did something clever. He made himself emperor and planned to rule until he died. This meant Rome was no longer a republic. But Augustus kept many old traditions. He let Romans keep the Senate and consuls. Still, everyone knew that Augustus was really in charge.

---

Augustus brought peace to Rome after many years of fighting. During his reign, he decided to reform the government and conquer new lands. He built amazing monuments and magnificent new buildings. These included temples, theaters, and bath houses. He also fixed old buildings and decorated them with fancy stone like marble. Augustus once said proudly that he ""found Rome brick and left it marble.""
One of the most famous buildings built during Augustus's time was the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built as a temple to honor all the Roman gods. The word parts ""pan"" means all and ""theo"" means gods. The Pantheon is a beautiful building with a round dome roof. The original building burned down in a fire, but the Pantheon standing today was built to replace it. Thousands of people visit it every day.

---

The Pantheon is just one example of great Roman architecture. Another famous building is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was built shortly after Augustus's reign. It is a huge, oval stadium where Romans went to watch people and animals fight. The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand people. Today the Colosseum is in ruins, but enough is left to show us what it looked like long ago.
Romans also loved watching chariot races. These exciting races were held in an even bigger stadium called the Circus Maximus. For Romans, a chariot race or a fight was great entertainment, just like a football game or movie is for us today.

---

The Romans also built roads and aqueducts. The roads helped people travel from all around the Empire.

Augustus brought peace to Rome after many years of fighting. During his reign, he decided to reform the government and conquer new lands. He built amazing monuments and magnificent new buildings. These included temples, theaters, and bath houses. He also fixed old buildings and decorated them with fancy stone like marble. Augustus once said proudly that he ""found Rome brick and left it marble.""
One of the most famous buildings built during Augustus's time was the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built as a temple to honor all the Roman gods. The word parts ""pan"" means all and ""theo"" means gods. The Pantheon is a beautiful building with a round dome roof. The original building burned down in a fire, but the Pantheon standing today was built to replace it. Thousands of people visit it every day.

        The men who killed Julius Caesar wanted to save the republic. But they did not succeed. After Caesar died, another civil war started. The man who won the war was called Augustus Caesar, or just Augustus.
Augustus was Caesar's adopted son. He agreed with Caesar that Rome needed to change. But Augustus was very smart. He knew that Romans loved their history and old ways. They would be angry if he changed everything at once. So Augustus did something clever. He made himself emperor and planned to rule until he died. This meant Rome was no longer a republic. But Augustus kept many old traditions. He let Romans keep the Senate and consuls. Still, everyone knew that Augustus was really in charge.

Augustus brought peace to Rome after many years of fighting. During his reign, he decided to reform the government and conquer new lands. He built amazing monuments and magnificent new buildings. These included temples, theaters, and bath houses. He also fixed old buildings and decorated them with fancy stone like marble. Augustus once said proudly that he ""found Rome brick and left it marble.""
One of the most famous buildings built during Augustus's time was the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built as a temple to honor all the Roman gods. The word parts ""pan"" means all and ""theo"" means gods. The Pantheon is a beautiful building with a round dome roof. The original building burned down in a fire, but the Pantheon standing today was built to replace it. Thousands of people visit it every day.

The Pantheon is just one example of great Roman architecture. Another famous building is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was built shortly after Augustus's reign. It is a huge, oval stadium where Romans went to watch people and animals fight. The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand people. Today the Colosseum is in ruins, but enough is left to show us what it looked like long ago.

        The men who killed Julius Caesar wanted to save the republic. But they did not succeed. After Caesar died, another civil war started. The man who won the war was called Augustus Caesar, or just Augustus.
Augustus was Caesar's adopted son. He agreed with Caesar that Rome needed to change. But Augustus was very smart. He knew that Romans loved their history and old ways. They would be angry if he changed everything at once. So Augustus did something clever. He made himself emperor and planned to rule until he died. This meant Rome was no longer a republic. But Augustus kept many old traditions. He let Romans keep the Senate and consuls. Still, everyone knew that Augustus was really in charge.

---

Augustus brought peace to Rome after many years of fighting. During his reign, he decided to reform the government and conquer new lands. He built amazing monuments and magnificent new buildings. These included temples, theaters, and bath houses. He also fixed old buildings and decorated them with fancy stone like marble. Augustus once said proudly that he ""found Rome brick and left it marble.""
One of the most famous buildings built during Augustus's time was the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built as a temple to honor all the Roman gods. The word parts ""pan"" means all and ""theo"" means gods. The Pantheon is a beautiful building with a round dome roof. The original building burned down in a fire, but the Pantheon standing today was built to replace it. Thousands of people visit it every day.

The Pantheon is just one example of great Roman architecture. Another famous building is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was built shortly after Augustus's reign. It is a huge, oval stadium where Romans went to watch people and animals fight. The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand people. Today the Colosseum is in ruins, but enough is left to show us what it looked like long ago.
Romans also loved watching chariot races. These exciting races were held in an even bigger stadium called the Circus Maximus. For Romans, a chariot race or a fight was great entertainment, just like a football game or movie is for us today.

        Long ago in Rome, there was a slave named Androcles. He ran away from his master because he was treated badly. One night, Androcles found a cave in the mountains. He went inside the dark cave to hide and fell asleep on the cold ground.
In the middle of the night, a loud roaring sound woke him up. Androcles looked around in the darkness and saw something that scared him. A huge lion was coming into the cave! This was the lion's home. Androcles moved back against the cave wall. He thought the lion would kill him.
But then Androcles saw that something was wrong with the lion. The big cat was limping and roaring because it was hurt. The lion lay down and lifted up its front paw. It kept licking the paw over and over.

---

Androcles felt sorry for the lion. He decided to crouch down next to the hurt animal. The lion looked at him with sad eyes, like it was asking for help. Androcles looked at the paw and saw a big thorn stuck deep inside it. Very carefully, he reached out and pulled the thorn out of the lion's paw.
The lion purred and looked at Androcles with kind eyes. From that day on, they became the best of friends. Androcles learned to befriend the wild animal. They lived together in the cave for many months. They shared food and kept each other warm at night. The lion protected Androcles, and Androcles took care of the lion.

---

One day, Roman soldiers found Androcles hiding in the cave. The law said that runaway slaves must be punished. The soldiers captured Androcles and took him back to Rome. They put him in jail and gave him only water and old bread to eat.
After ten days, the guards told Androcles he would have to fight in the Colosseum. This was a huge building where Romans watched fights for fun. Runaway slaves were often forced to fight vicious wild animals or strong gladiators. Most slaves died in these fights. Androcles knew he would probably die, but he was brave.

        Long ago in Rome, there was a slave named Androcles. He ran away from his master because he was treated badly. One night, Androcles found a cave in the mountains. He went inside the dark cave to hide and fell asleep on the cold ground.
In the middle of the night, a loud roaring sound woke him up. Androcles looked around in the darkness and saw something that scared him. A huge lion was coming into the cave! This was the lion's home. Androcles moved back against the cave wall. He thought the lion would kill him.
But then Androcles saw that something was wrong with the lion. The big cat was limping and roaring because it was hurt. The lion lay down and lifted up its front paw. It kept licking the paw over and over.

---

Androcles felt sorry for the lion. He decided to crouch down next to the hurt animal. The lion looked at him with sad eyes, like it was asking for help. Androcles looked at the paw and saw a big thorn stuck deep inside it. Very carefully, he reached out and pulled the thorn out of the lion's paw.
The lion purred and looked at Androcles with kind eyes. From that day on, they became the best of friends. Androcles learned to befriend the wild animal. They lived together in the cave for many months. They shared food and kept each other warm at night. The lion protected Androcles, and Androcles took care of the lion.

---

One day, Roman soldiers found Androcles hiding in the cave. The law said that runaway slaves must be punished. The soldiers captured Androcles and took him back to Rome. They put him in jail and gave him only water and old bread to eat.
After ten days, the guards told Androcles he would have to fight in the Colosseum. This was a huge building where Romans watched fights for fun. Runaway slaves were often forced to fight vicious wild animals or strong gladiators. Most slaves died in these fights. Androcles knew he would probably die, but he was brave.
