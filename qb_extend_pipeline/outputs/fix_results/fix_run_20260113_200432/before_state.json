Firstly, the question references a phrase, 'in the past few decades', which does not appear in the provided passage, making it impossible for students to answer based on the text. This lack of context can confuse students and is not suitable testing practice. Secondly, the question may hinge on understanding the concept of 'decades', which could be too complex for Grade 3 reasoning about specific time intervals and historical context. The comprehension of chronological concepts and their implications could challenge Grade 3 students excessively. Error in source material connection and potential conceptual difficulty makes this question inappropriate for the specified grade level."
