His father worked as a tailor, making clothes for people. When his father died, Aladdin's mother had to work hard to earn money for food and shelter.One day, a stranger walked up to Aladdin on the street. \"Tell me, young man,\" said the stranger. \"Are you the son of the tailor who lived here?\"\"Yes, I am,\" said Aladdin.The stranger threw his arms around Aladdin and hugged him tight. \"My dear nephew!\" he cried out. \"Your father was my brother! Now I learn that he has died! What terrible news!\"\n\n---\n\nAladdin brought the man home to meet his mother. She felt very surprised because her husband had never told her about having a brother. Even so, she welcomed the man into their home. When the stranger promised to help Aladdin learn to become a merchant and earn good money, she believed his words.But the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all. He was actually a powerful magician who had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp. People said this lamp had amazing powers that would make any person very rich. To find this lamp, the magician needed someone to help him. He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, the magician came to Aladdin's house. \"Come with me today,\" he said to the boy. \"I want to introduce you to other merchants in the city.\" Then he led Aladdin away from town and out into the countryside.The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.\"Go gather some dry sticks,\" the magician told Aladdin. \"We will build a fire here. Then I will show you something truly amazing.\"Aladdin did exactly what the man asked him to do. The magician lit the fire with the sticks. Then he threw sweet-smelling perfumes into the flames and spoke magical words in a loud voice. Suddenly, the bright sky turned dark like night. Thunder crashed and rumbled all around them. The earth split open right at their feet. There in front of them lay a huge stone with a brass ring attached to it.\n\n---\n\n\"Under this heavy stone lies a great treasure,\" said the magician. \"It will make you richer than any king in the world. Lift the stone by pulling on the ring. Then go down the stairs. You will see many treasures as you walk, but you must not touch any of them. You will come to a beautiful garden. In that garden, you will see a lamp hanging from a tree. Bring that lamp back to me. Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.\"Aladdin felt amazed by what he heard. He could hardly believe what the magician was asking him to do. But he agreed to help.\"Take this special ring,\" said the magician. \"It will keep you safe from any harm.\" Aladdin took the ring and put it on his finger. Then he pulled the heavy stone up by its brass ring and went down into the dark cave below.Aladdin found the lamp and filled his bag with beautiful gems. But all those gems made his bag very heavy. When he climbed back to the top of the stairs, he could not pull himself out of the cave opening.\"Give me your hand, Uncle,\" Aladdin called out. \"Help me climb out!\"\"First, hand me the lamp,\" the magician answered back.The lamp was buried deep in Aladdin's heavy bag. \"I cannot reach it right now,\" Aladdin said.The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer. He spoke a magic spell, and the stone rolled back into place. Poor Aladdin was trapped in the dark cave below.\n\n## Reference Questions (for quality benchmark, NOT for copying):\n\n### Reference Question 1 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.4 - Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from nonliteral language.\n- Question: In the story, the magician tells Aladdin that finding the lamp will make him \"richer than any king in the world.\"What does this phrase mean?\n- A) Aladdin will have more money than he can count\n- B) Aladdin will become the ruler of a kingdom\n- C) Aladdin will find gold coins in the cave\n- D) Aladdin will meet kings from other countries\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.4.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 2 (DOK 2, medium):\n- Standard: RL.3.3 - Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events.\n- Question: What causes the magician to trap Aladdin in the cave?\n- A) Aladdin doesn't give him the lamp right away.\n- B) Aladdin won't to go into the cave.\n- C) Aladdin takes too many gems from the cave.\n- D) Aladdin breaks the magic ring on his finger.\n- Correct: A\n\n**Create 4 DIVERSE variants for this question at DOK 2, difficulty medium, CCSS RL.3.3.**\n\nDOK 2 Requirements for siblings:\n- Apply skills and concepts to make basic inferences\n- Classify, organize, or compare information\n- Make connections between ideas\n- Cannot be answered by simple recall alone\n\n### Reference Question 3 (DOK 3, hard):\n- Standard: RL.3.2 - Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures;

The text uses 'the earth split open' as figurative language to describe how the ground opened up to reveal the stone covering the cave entrance. This phrase creates a dramatic image of the magical moment when the treasure location was revealed. The author chose this vivid description to show the power of the magician's spell.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While earthquakes do make the earth shake and crack, the text describes a magical opening that revealed a stone with a brass ring, not damage from an earthquake. Review how the magician's spell caused a specific opening to appear, not random shaking. The phrase describes the result of magic, not a natural disaster.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician didn't physically dig - he used magic words and perfume in the fire. The phrase 'split open' is figurative language showing something dramatic and magical happened, not manual labor. Reread the paragraph to see that the opening appeared suddenly after the spell, not from digging tools.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Although thunder did crash around them, the text doesn't say lightning struck the ground. The earth splitting open happened because of the magician's spell, not from a lightning strike. Pay attention to the sequence: the spell caused darkness and thunder, then the ground opened to reveal the stone.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 3 about the magical moment when the cave entrance appears - differs from reference which asks about wealth/riches phrase in paragraph 4.

The phrase 'earn money for food and shelter' means Aladdin's mother had to work just to afford the most basic necessities of living - things people need to survive like eating and having a home. The text emphasizes they were poor and struggling after the father died. This phrase shows the family's difficult situation and why they might trust a stranger who promised to help.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Food and shelter are basic survival needs, not expensive luxuries. The story emphasizes that Aladdin's family was poor, so his mother was working for necessities, not wants. Reread paragraph 1 to understand their difficult situation - they needed money just to survive, not for extras.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text doesn't mention travel plans. The phrase specifically says the money was for 'food and shelter' - immediate survival needs, not future travel. Remember that the family was poor and struggling, so saving for a trip wouldn't be their priority when they needed basics.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While education is important, the text specifically states the money was for 'food and shelter,' not schooling. The story actually shows Aladdin wasn't learning a trade yet - that's why the magician's offer seemed appealing. Focus on what the text directly states about their immediate needs.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 1 about the mother's economic situation and daily survival - differs from reference which asks about future wealth promise in paragraph 4.

The text doesn't say Aladdin needs to read or speak magic words - only the magician does that. The passage explains that the magician wanted someone who 'would follow his directions without asking too many questions.' Reread paragraph 2 to see what qualities the magician was actually looking for in a helper.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The text directly explains that the magician 'wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions. He thought Aladdin was exactly the right person for this job.' This phrase shows the magician chose Aladdin because he seemed obedient and trusting, not because of special skills. The author uses this to help readers understand the magician's manipulative plan.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While Aladdin does lift the stone later, the text specifically states the magician wanted someone who would follow directions without questions, not someone physically strong. The magic ring was given for safety, and Aladdin's obedience was the key quality. Review paragraph 2 for the magician's actual reasoning.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin had never been in a cave before and knew nothing about finding treasures. The text explains the magician chose him because he would be obedient and follow orders, not because of treasure-hunting experience.

The phrase about throwing perfumes into flames is part of describing a magic spell. The text shows this is a ritual by including other magical elements: the magician 'spoke magical words in a loud voice,' the sky turned dark, and thunder crashed. The perfumes in the fire are part of the magic ceremony to open the earth. This descriptive language helps readers understand the supernatural power of the scene.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While perfumes do create pleasant smells, the text shows this action was part of a magical spell, not about improving odors. Notice that right after throwing the perfumes, the magician spoke magical words and dramatic supernatural events happened. The perfumes were a component of magic, not air freshening.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text gives no indication of cooking. The perfumes were thrown into the fire along with magical words, causing the earth to split open - this is clearly a magic ritual, not meal preparation. Reread paragraph 3 to see how this action connects to the supernatural events that follow.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The passage doesn't mention any animals on the mountain. The perfumes were part of a magical spell that made the sky dark and opened the earth. This action is connected to magic and finding the treasure, not protection from wildlife. Focus on how the text links this action to supernatural results.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 3 about the magical spell-casting scene - differs from reference which asks about wealth metaphor in paragraph 4.

The magician doesn't care about making Aladdin stronger. The text clearly states 'The magician grew very angry' and 'He only cared about getting the magic lamp.' His refusal to help wasn't about teaching Aladdin anything - it was because he was impatient and angry. Review the final paragraph to see his true motivation.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The text directly explains the magician's motivation: 'The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp. When Aladdin said he would give it to him after climbing out, the impatient magician could not wait any longer.' Because Aladdin couldn't hand over the lamp right away, the angry magician refused to help and trapped him instead. This shows the magician's selfish character - his anger and impatience caused him to abandon Aladdin.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The depth of the cave wasn't the problem. The magician asked for the lamp before helping, showing he could reach Aladdin but chose not to help. The text explains his anger and impatience caused his refusal, not a physical inability to reach. Reread the ending to see his deliberate choice.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician didn't need another spell to help Aladdin climb out - he simply needed to extend his hand. The text shows he refused because of anger: 'The magician grew very angry' and couldn't wait for the lamp. His refusal was an emotional decision based on impatience, not a magical requirement.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets final paragraph about the climactic betrayal moment - differs from reference which asks about the same cause-effect but focuses on different aspect of magician's motivation.

The text explicitly states 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' and explains he came to find the magic lamp, not to help family. His kind words were fake. Review paragraph 2 which reveals his true identity as a magician with selfish goals, not a caring relative.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The story shows the magician is deceptive through his actions at the house: he falsely claimed to be Aladdin's uncle, hugged Aladdin pretending to be family, and promised to help him become a merchant. The text then reveals 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' and that 'He wanted to find a person who would follow his directions without asking too many questions.' His willingness to lie and manipulate shows his dishonest character. This behavior foreshadows his later betrayal.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the magician promised to help Aladdin become a merchant, this was a lie. The text explains he was 'actually a powerful magician' searching for a magic lamp, not a merchant seeking a partner. His merchant story was part of his deception to gain trust and manipulate Aladdin.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician didn't make a mistake - he deliberately lied. The text clearly states he 'was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' and explains he came specifically to find the lamp. He intentionally pretended to be family as part of his plan. There was no confusion; it was calculated deception.\",\"differentiation_notes\":\"Targets paragraph 2 about the house visit and false identity revelation - differs from reference which asks about cave betrayal cause-effect.

While the magician did perform a spell, the question asks how beginning actions contribute to the ending. The spell opened the cave but didn't make Aladdin brave. The key connection is that the magician's early lies (pretending to be uncle, promising to help) made Aladdin trust him enough to go into the cave, which led to the betrayal. Focus on cause-and-effect across the whole story.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The story shows a clear sequence of events: at the beginning, the magician falsely claimed to be Aladdin's uncle and promised to help him become a wealthy merchant. These lies made Aladdin and his mother trust the stranger. Because of this trust, Aladdin agreed to go with the magician and follow his instructions to get the lamp. This trust is what allowed the magician to manipulate Aladdin into the dangerous situation where he was eventually betrayed and trapped. The early deception directly caused the later betrayal.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The ring didn't prevent Aladdin from being trapped - the story ends with him trapped in the cave. While the ring was given early in the story, it didn't protect him from the magician's betrayal. The text shows the connection between early lies building trust and later betrayal, not between the ring and protection from trapping.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect.

The text shows Aladdin demonstrates both obedience and independence: he followed the magician's main instruction to get the lamp ('Aladdin found the lamp'), but he also made his own decision to fill his bag with beautiful gems.

His actions later create the problem when the bag becomes too heavy, but they show his thinking independently.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The text shows Aladdin successfully went down into the cave, found the lamp, and collected gems - these are not the actions of someone too scared to explore. He completed the task he was given. Fear isn't mentioned as motivating his behavior; instead, the story shows him actively gathering treasures.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin didn't disobey - the magician told him 'Once you have the lamp, you may take any treasures you want.' Aladdin got the lamp first, then took gems, which was exactly what he was allowed to do.

Aladdin wasn't too weak - he successfully filled his bag with gems and climbed back up the stairs.

The story doesn't teach about sharing treasures - in fact, the magician's demand for the lamp immediately is what causes the problem. The lesson is about the danger of the magician's false promises at the beginning, not about sharing at the end. The magician wasn't truly helping Aladdin; he was using him.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. Aladdin doesn't escape - the story ends with him trapped in the cave. Magic is shown as something the villain uses, not as a helpful tool for the hero. The lesson focuses on the consequences of trusting the magician's promises about wealth and help, not about using magic to solve problems.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct! The story teaches this lesson through the sequence of events: the magician made amazing promises (help Aladdin become a rich merchant, make him richer than any king), but these promises were lies to manipulate Aladdin. Aladdin's mother trusted the stranger because 'she believed his words,' even though she was surprised about the unknown brother. The result of this trust was betrayal and danger. The story shows how the magician's too-good-to-be-true promises (instant wealth, family help) were actually traps, teaching readers to be cautious about strangers making extraordinary offers.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story doesn't emphasize hard work as a solution or lesson. Neither Aladdin nor the magician are shown working hard - instead, they seek treasure through magic.

The author uses specific details to emphasize isolation: 'The magician took Aladdin up a very steep mountain path. They climbed higher and higher for a whole hour. Finally, they reached a spot where no flowers or plants could grow. The ground looked empty and bare.' The hour-long climb up a steep path, combined with the barren landscape description, shows readers this place is remote and far from help. This detail is important because it explains why Aladdin couldn't easily get help when trapped and adds to the danger of the situation.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While Aladdin's mother did stay home, the text doesn't use this detail to show the mountain's isolation. The story emphasizes the mountain's remoteness through descriptions of the long, steep climb and the barren landscape where nothing grows. The mother staying home is about the characters' actions, not about describing the setting's isolation.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician used magic to open the cave entrance, not to find the location. The text shows isolation through physical details: the steep path, the hour-long climb, and the barren ground. The magic spell was for revealing the hidden treasure entrance, not for locating a remote spot.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. No other merchants were waiting - that was part of the magician's lie. He told Aladdin he would introduce him to merchants, but instead led him away from town into the remote countryside.

The story shows the opposite - the magician uses magic for selfish, harmful purposes by trapping Aladdin. This doesn't support a message about magic being used for good. The central message is about the danger of trusting the magician's false promises, not about how magic is used.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Correct! The magician's decision to trap Aladdin is the climax that proves the story's central warning. Throughout the story, Aladdin and his mother trusted the stranger based only on his words (claiming to be family, promising wealth and help). The betrayal at the end shows the dangerous result of this trust. The author uses the magician's cruel decision to trap Aladdin to demonstrate what can happen when people believe promises from strangers without questioning their true motives. This moment reveals the story's lesson about being cautious with trust.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The magician falsely claimed to be family but wasn't, and he abandoned Aladdin instead of protecting him. This actually supports the opposite message - that people who claim to be family might be lying. The story warns against trusting people just because they say they're family, not that real family always protects you.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. While the magician did value the lamp more than Aladdin's safety, this isn't the lesson for readers. The story isn't teaching that wealth is more important - it's warning readers about the danger of trusting people like the magician who make false promises.

The author includes this geographical detail to emphasize the lamp's extraordinary value. The text states the magician 'had traveled from far away in North Africa. He had come all the way to Persia to search for a special magic lamp.' The phrase 'all the way' and the emphasis on the great distance show readers that the lamp must be extremely valuable and powerful - valuable enough that someone would travel across continents to find it. This detail helps readers understand why the magician goes to such extreme lengths, including lying and betrayal, to obtain the lamp. It supports the story's message by showing how greed can drive people to dangerous deception.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story never mentions language barriers - the magician and Aladdin communicate easily throughout. The distance detail isn't about language differences; it's about showing how valuable the lamp must be for someone to travel so far. Focus on why the author emphasizes 'all the way to Persia' in the context of searching for the lamp.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The distance actually contradicts the family claim - the text reveals 'the stranger was not really Aladdin's uncle at all' and explains he was from North Africa. If anything, the great distance makes the family connection more suspicious. The distance detail serves to show the lamp's value, not to support the false family story.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story doesn't compare magic from different countries or explain different magical systems. The magician's origin is mentioned specifically in the context of his search for the lamp, not to discuss types of magic.

While the magic spell is dramatic and opens the cave, it doesn't explain WHY the magician betrays Aladdin. The spell is just a tool to access the treasure. The key to understanding the betrayal is knowing the magician's true motivation - that he only wanted the lamp for himself and didn't care about Aladdin. This selfish goal explains why he abandons the boy.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The promise to make Aladdin rich was a lie to manipulate him into helping. While this shows the magician is deceptive, it doesn't directly explain the betrayal at the end. The most important detail for understanding the betrayal is that the magician 'only cared about getting the magic lamp' for himself - this selfish motivation explains why he traps Aladdin when he can't get the lamp immediately.\",\"option_3_explanation\":\"Correct! The text explicitly states: 'The magician grew very angry. He only cared about getting the magic lamp.' This detail is most important because it reveals the magician's true motivation - complete selfishness. Understanding that the magician never cared about Aladdin and only wanted the lamp for himself explains why he would betray and trap the boy. All the other events (the spell, the promises, the ring) were just tools to get the lamp. This detail about caring only for the lamp is the key to understanding the betrayal and supports the story's central message about the danger of trusting selfish people who make false promises.\",\"option_4_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The ring was meant to keep Aladdin safe during the task, but it doesn't explain why the betrayal happens. Giving the ring actually seems kind, which makes it confusing if you think that explains the betrayal.

The story demonstrates this lesson through the magician's arc: he seems helpful initially (claiming to be family, promising to help Aladdin become a merchant), but his true selfish intentions are revealed through his later actions (leading Aladdin to a remote location, demanding the lamp immediately, trapping him when refused). The text states he 'only cared about getting the magic lamp,' revealing that his helpful appearance was fake. The author shows that the magician's eventual actions (the betrayal) exposed his real character. This supports the story's central message about being cautious with people who make big promises, because their true nature will show through their behavior when they don't get what they want.\",\"option_2_explanation\":\"Incorrect. The story teaches the opposite - the magician seemed helpful but was actually lying and manipulating Aladdin. His promises were false, and he didn't want to help Aladdin succeed.
