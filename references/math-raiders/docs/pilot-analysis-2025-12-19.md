### Key Findings

- **Pre→Post: +6.1 avg** (formal controlled measure)
- **3/9 exceeded all-time AMF peak** (Octavia, Analea, Oslo)
- **Engagement matters:** All negative outcomes had low engagement or late accuracy focus
- **6/9 didn't break through all-time peak:**
  - Nova: +7 pre→post, but below their Nov peak of 26
  - Ren: +6 pre→post, but below their Nov peak of 13
  - Jace: +3 pre→post, but below their Oct peak of 16
  - Everett: -1 pre→post, high volume but late accuracy correction
  - Wyatt: -1 pre→post, lowest engagement (5.3 min/day)
  - Ansel: -2 pre→post, started late + low engagement (7.2 min/day)

*Nova: Pre-test Dec 8 (16), Post-test Jan 6 (23). Improved but below all-time peak.*

*Ren: Practiced add + ALL (G2 ALL includes sub). Tested on subtraction.*

*Jace: Pre-test Dec 8 (5), Post-test Jan 23 (8). 46-day gap.*

*Everett: Dec 19 post-test = 24 (-1 from Dec 4 baseline of 25). A Jan 5 follow-up showed 29 CQPM (+4) after Winter break.*

*Wyatt: Pre-test Nov 21 (14), Post-test Jan 7 (13). Lowest engagement at 5.3 min/day.*

### Lost to Follow-Up (n=5)

These students showed gains during the pilot but cannot be validated due to leaving school or not being re-enrolled in AlphaNumbers after grade resets.

*Landen: 1 Sub raid in MR (mostly practiced Add + ALL).*

*Proof MR underestimates: Octavia MR 30.8→AMF 36 (+17%), Analea 29→33 (+14%), Oslo 18.7→25 (+34%).*

## Part 3: Qualitative Feedback

### Efficacy + Engagement (Strongest Signals)

> **Jessica (Dec 19):** "My kids were all impressed with **how easy FM is now** that they've been doing Math Raiders."

> **Octavia (Dec 19):** "It's way better than Fast Math, they should just **cancel out FM and make it all Math Raiders.**"

> **Jessica (Dec 15):** "The kids decided as a group today to **stay in and give up half their q-break** so they could play extra Math Raiders. It went to a vote."

> **Analea (Dec 19):** "I love it! **I don't want this to go away** when you're done testing it."

### Retention + Demand

> **Jessica (Dec 15):** "You've made a winner here, **all my kids except one have been getting more than the required XP** since we started."

> **Jessica (Dec 19):** "They wanted to **send you a Christmas present**, but I had to put a stop to that discussion."

> **Janna Peskett (Dec 10):** "That is **VERY encouraging** if her brother wanted to play your math game **at home**. The DRI asked if we could get it for Atticus."

> **Jessica (Dec 19):** "You've **created agency** in these children, and they will not focus on other core skills because this is leaving and they are having too much fun."

### Guide Feedback (Multiple Cohorts)

> **Samantha Hilton (Dec 9):** "Emma said that it's **so much better than Fast Math.**"

> **Joshua Goldstein (Dec 15):** "Landen is doing **much better with Math Raiders instead of regular fast math**."

> **Camren Allred (Dec 12):** "They are **much more motivated and locked in** during their FastMath time."

> **Isabella Castellanos (Dec 18):** "It is **his favorite way to earn XP.**"

> **Grant Cain (Dec 12):** "They both seem to be into it. Trying to limit them to 10 minutes a day... but getting 10xp in that time seems difficult."

## Recommendations

### What Worked

1. **Engagement** — Top students voluntarily played 15-37 min/day
2. **Skill Transfer** — In-game peaks matched AMF improvements
3. **Emotional Investment** — "I don't want this to go away"
4. **Breakthrough Performance** — 3/9 validated students hit all-time peaks; 6/9 improved

### What Didn't Work (and Fixes)

1. **Assessment Compliance** — 50% validation rate. 5 students lost to follow-up (left school or not re-enrolled).
2. **Timing** — Pre-break window. Guides prioritized other tasks over post-test follow-through. **Fix:** Upfront guide commitment + non-break timing (students can take AMF in days after).
3. **Fact Acquisition** — Jimmy needed to practice mult, but from his AMF scores he's struggling and avoids it (understandably) in MR.
